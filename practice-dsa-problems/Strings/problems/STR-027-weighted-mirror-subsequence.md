# STR-027: Weighted Mirror Subsequence

## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and a weight matrix for pairs of characters, find the maximum possible score of any palindromic subsequence.

For a chosen palindromic subsequence, the score is the sum of weights of mirrored pairs. If the subsequence has odd length, the middle character `c` contributes `weight[c][c]`.

## Input Format

- First line: string `s`
- Next 26 lines: 26 integers each, the weight matrix for `a` to `z`

## Output Format

- Single integer: maximum achievable score

## Constraints

- `1 <= |s| <= 2000`
- `-10^9 <= weight[i][j] <= 10^9`
- `s` contains only lowercase English letters

## Clarifying Notes

- The subsequence must read the same forward and backward.
- Use 64-bit integers for the score.
