# STR-002: Unique Character Locator

## Problem Statement

## Output Format

- Single character (the first unique), or `-1`

## Constraints

- `s` contains printable ASCII characters

## Clarifying Notes

- Character matching is case-sensitive.
- If multiple unique characters exist, return the one with smallest index.
