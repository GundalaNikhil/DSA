## 🚨 PROBLEMS TO AVOID

### DO NOT CREATE - Too Famous:

❌ "Koko eating bananas"
❌ "Burst balloons"
❌ "Serialize/Deserialize tree"
❌ "Clone list with random pointers"
❌ "Maximum area histogram"
❌ "Sliding window maximum"
❌ "Stock with 2 transactions"
❌ "Word ladder"
❌ "Minimum genetic mutation"
❌ "Cheapest flights K stops"
❌ "Painter's partition"
❌ "Split array largest sum"
❌ "Longest palindromic subsequence"
❌ "Count palindromic subsequences"
❌ "Predict the winner"

---

## 💡 TIPS FOR CREATING SAFE PROBLEMS

### 1. Start with the Scenario, Not the Algorithm
- ❌ "Implement Dijkstra's algorithm"
- ✅ "Build a network latency calculator for a data center"

### 2. Use Industry-Specific Language
- ❌ "Find shortest path in graph"
- ✅ "Optimize delivery routes for same-day shipping"

### 3. Create Original Examples
- ❌ Using `[1,2,3,4,5]` (too generic)
- ✅ Using `prices = [49, 89, 79, 99, 59]` (specific context)

### 4. Modify Constraints Slightly
- ❌ `1 <= n <= 10^5` (standard)
- ✅ `1 <= n <= 100,000` (same value, different format)
- ✅ `2 <= n <= 50,000` (different range)

### 5. Add Business Context
- ❌ "Return the maximum sum"
- ✅ "Calculate the maximum revenue achievable within budget constraints"
