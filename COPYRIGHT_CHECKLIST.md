# Copyright & Plagiarism Checklist

## ✅ CURRENT STATUS: MOSTLY SAFE WITH MINOR ISSUES

### Overall Assessment

Your DSA problem repository has been designed with **original real-world scenarios** and unique problem framing, which significantly reduces copyright concerns. However, there are some issues that need attention before launching a commercial coding platform.

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

### 1. **Use of "leetcode" in Example Inputs**

**Files Affected:**

- `/dsa-problems/hash-tables/001-coupon-code-validator.md` (lines 37, 43)
- `/dsa-problems/dynamic-programming/005-word-break-dictionary.md` (lines 40, 42)

**Issue:** Using the string "leetcode" in examples could be seen as:

- Implied endorsement or association
- Potential trademark concerns
- Suggesting content is derived from LeetCode

**Recommendation:** ✅ Replace with generic strings like:

- "discount" / "coupon2024"
- "developer" / "codemaster"
- "platform" / "validator"

---

## ⚠️ MODERATE CONCERNS

### 2. **Classic Algorithm Problems**

**Examples:**

- Sudoku Solver (BACK-002)
- Coin Change (DP-003)
- Reverse Linked List (LL-001)

**Issue:** These are well-known algorithmic problems that appear on multiple platforms.

**Why It's Acceptable:**

- ✅ You've reframed them with **unique real-world scenarios** (music playlists, vending machines, newspaper puzzles)
- ✅ Original problem descriptions and explanations
- ✅ Custom examples and constraints
- ✅ Different presentation style

**Legal Standing:** **SAFE** - Algorithms themselves cannot be copyrighted, only specific expressions. Your unique framing makes this original content.

## 🟢 STRENGTHS (Copyright Protection)

### What You're Doing Right:

1. **✅ Original Problem Framing**

   - Real-world scenarios (Music Playlist Navigator, Temperature Fluctuation Analyzer)
   - Custom narratives (Rewind Through Memories, Weather Forecaster)
   - Practical applications

2. **✅ Unique Problem Names**

   - "Temperature Fluctuation Analyzer" instead of "Maximum Subarray"
   - "Music Playlist Navigator" instead of "Reverse Linked List"
   - Custom slugs and identifiers

3. **✅ Original Company Examples**

   - Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music
   - Weather.com, AccuWeather
   - Coinbase, Square, PayPal

4. **✅ Custom Content Structure**
   - "A Simple Scenario (Daily Life Usage)" section
   - "Why is it Important?" educational context
   - Unique problem metadata (Problem ID, Display ID, Slug)

## 📋 COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST

### Before Launch:

- [ ] Remove all instances of "leetcode" from examples
- [ ] Add copyright notice to all problem files
- [ ] Create Terms of Service
- [ ] Add disclaimer about problem originality
- [ ] Review "Asked by Companies" sections for accuracy
- [ ] Add attribution if using any third-party algorithms/concepts
- [ ] Ensure no direct copying of problem descriptions from other platforms
- [ ] Add user-generated content policy
- [ ] Create DMCA takedown policy
- [ ] Consult with IP attorney for final review

## 🛡️ RECOMMENDED ADDITIONS

### 1. Add Copyright Notice

Add to each problem file:

```markdown
---
**Copyright Notice:** This problem and its description are original content created by [Your Platform Name]. 
Unauthorized reproduction or distribution is prohibited.
---
```

### 2. Add Repository-Level License

Create a LICENSE file with appropriate terms (e.g., Creative Commons, All Rights Reserved)

### 3. Add Disclaimer

```markdown
## Disclaimer

While this problem may involve classic algorithms or data structures that are part of common
computer science knowledge, all problem descriptions, scenarios, examples, and explanations
are original content created specifically for this platform.
```

---

## 🎯 SPECIFIC ACTIONS REQUIRED

### High Priority (Fix Before Launch):

1. **Replace "leetcode" strings** in example inputs
2. **Add copyright headers** to all problem files
3. **Create LICENSE file** for the repository
4. **Add Terms of Service** for platform usage

### Medium Priority:

1. **Verify company names** in "Asked by Companies" sections are accurate
2. **Add disclaimers** about algorithmic concepts vs. original content
3. **Create content policy** document
4. **Review all problem descriptions** for any accidentally copied phrases

### Low Priority (Post-Launch):

1. Implement plagiarism detection for user submissions
2. Create content reporting system
3. Regular audits of new problems added

---

## 💡 LEGAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### What You CAN Do:

✅ Use common algorithmic concepts (sorting, searching, graph traversal)
✅ Create original problems based on classic algorithms
✅ Reference real companies (unless explicitly trademarked contexts)
✅ Use generic programming terminology
✅ Teach standard data structures

### What You SHOULD AVOID:

❌ Copying exact problem descriptions from other platforms
❌ Using trademarked names in problematic ways
❌ Claiming originality for well-known algorithms
❌ Copying test cases verbatim from other sources
❌ Using proprietary problem IDs from other platforms

## 🔍 COMPARISON WITH OTHER PLATFORMS

### How Your Content Differs:

| Aspect          | LeetCode/HackerRank     | Your Platform              |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Problem Framing | Abstract/Technical      | Real-world scenarios       |
| Problem Names   | Generic algorithm names | Creative, contextual names |
| Scenarios       | Minimal context         | Detailed daily-life usage  |
| Examples        | Technical examples      | Story-driven examples      |
| Structure       | Standard format         | Custom metadata + sections |

**Verdict:** Your content shows **substantial originality** through unique framing and presentation.
