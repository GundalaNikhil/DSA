## Statistics

- **Total Problems:** 16
- **Total Public Test Cases:** 50
- **Total Hidden Test Cases:** 415
- **Passing Problems:** 16/16 (100%)
- **Passing Public Tests:** 50/50 (100%)
- **Passing Hidden Tests:** 415/415 (100%)

## Test Coverage

All problems were tested with:

- ✅ Public test cases (visible to users)
- ✅ Hidden test cases (edge cases, large inputs, corner cases)
- ✅ Performance validation (all solutions completed within timeout limits)

## Solution Quality

All Python solutions demonstrate:

- ✅ Correct game theory concepts (Nim, Grundy numbers, XOR strategies)
- ✅ Efficient algorithms (dynamic programming, memoization)
- ✅ Proper handling of edge cases
- ✅ Clean, readable code structure
- ✅ Optimal time complexity for the problem constraints

## Verification Method

Testing was performed using:

- Python 3 runtime
- YAML test case files with input/output pairs
- Automated test runner comparing actual vs expected outputs
- 10-second timeout per test case

## Conclusion

The GameTheory module is **production-ready** with all Python solutions achieving 100% accuracy across all test cases. No changes to solutions, test cases, or editorials are required.
