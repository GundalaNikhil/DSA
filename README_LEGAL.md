## 🎓 KEY PRINCIPLES

### Why Your Content is Safe:

1. **Algorithms ≠ Your Content**
   - Algorithms (like binary search) are public domain
   - Your unique scenarios and examples are copyrighted

2. **Transformative Use**
   - You transformed technical algorithms into real-world problems
   - Different presentation = original content

3. **Proper Attribution**
   - Copyright notices claim your original work
   - Disclaimers clarify what's public vs. original

4. **No Trademark Violations**
   - No use of competitors' brand names
   - Generic industry terminology
   - Proper disclaimers for company mentions

5. **Substantial Originality**
   - Unique real-world scenarios
   - Original examples and explanations
   - Different structure and presentation

---

## 🚨 RED FLAGS TO AVOID

### Never Do This:

❌ Copy problem descriptions word-for-word from other platforms
❌ Use exact same examples as LeetCode/HackerRank
❌ Claim problems are "from Google" without proof
❌ Use competitor brand names in titles
❌ Copy test cases verbatim
❌ Ignore copyright notices on external content

### Always Do This:

✅ Create unique real-world scenarios
✅ Write original examples
✅ Add copyright notices to all content
✅ Include disclaimers
✅ Keep algorithms separate from presentation
✅ Verify no accidental copying
