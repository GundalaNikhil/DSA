    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "[1, 2, 3, 4]"
      - "[1, 3, 2, 4]"
      - "[1, 4, 2, 3]"
      - "[2, 1, 4, 3]"
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: "First half is [1,2], second half is [3,4]. Interleave alternates: 1, 4, 2, 3."

  - question: For even-length queue of size n, what are the indices of the two halves?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "[0..n/2-1] and [n/2..n-1]"
      - "[0..n/2] and [n/2+1..n-1]"
      - "[1..n/2] and [n/2+1..n]"
      - Always [0..4] and [5..n-1]
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "First half: indices 0 to n/2-1 (n/2 elements). Second half: n/2 to n-1 (n/2 elements)."

  - question: What is the formula for placing element at index i from first half in the result?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - result[i] = values[i]
      - result[2*i] = values[i]
      - result[2*i+1] = values[i]
      - result[n-i] = values[i]
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "First half elements occupy even indices: result[0], result[2], result[4], etc. Element i goes to position 2*i."

  - question: For element at index j in second half (j = mid + k where k >= 0), what is its result position?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - result[2*j]
      - result[2*k + 1]
      - result[j]
      - result[n - j - 1]
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Second half elements occupy odd indices. Element at second half index k goes to result[2*k+1].
