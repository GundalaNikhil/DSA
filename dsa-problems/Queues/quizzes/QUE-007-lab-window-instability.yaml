questions:
  - question: Window [5, 10, 3] has min=3, max=10, median=5. Instability = floor((10-3)/5) = ?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "1"
      - "2"
      - "0"
      - "7"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Instability formula: floor((max - min) / median) = floor(7 / 5) = floor(1.4) = 1."

  - question: What happens to instability if median equals 0?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Return 0 to avoid division by zero
      - Return infinity
      - The window has only 0 values
      - Undefined behavior
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "Special case: if median = 0, output 0 (stable window). Avoid division by zero error."

  - question: This problem requires three distinct techniques. Which is NOT one of them?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Deque for min/max in sliding window
      - Dual heaps for median computation
      - Lazy deletion for efficient removal
      - Binary search for element lookup
    correct_answer: 3
    explanation: "Techniques used: (1) Monotonic deques for min/max, (2) Dual heaps for median, (3) Lazy deletion. Binary search is NOT used."

  - question: Why does finding the median require O(log k) with heaps, not O(1)?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Heaps don't support fast median queries
      - Finding median requires balancing two heaps; lazy deletion adds overhead
      - Median is always at the root
      - It's actually O(1)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Dual heaps need rebalancing and lazy deletion complicates access. Overall O(n log k) for n windows of size k.
