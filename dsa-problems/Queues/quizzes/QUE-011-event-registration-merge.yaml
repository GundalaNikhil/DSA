  - question: Merging two sorted queues [1, 3, 5] and [2, 4, 6] gives which result?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]"
      - "[1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6]"
      - "[2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5]"
      - Undefined without knowing original order
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "Two-pointer merge: compare front of both queues, dequeue smaller, add to result. Repeat until both empty. Result: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]."

  - question: What is the time complexity of merging two sorted queues of size n and m?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O((n + m) log(n + m))
      - O(n + m)
      - O(nm)
      - O(max(n, m))
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Each element is processed exactly once with two-pointer technique. No sorting needed (inputs already sorted). Linear time: O(n + m)."

  - question: If one queue is empty and the other has [1, 2, 3], what's the merge result?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - "[1, 2, 3]"
      - "Error: cannot merge with empty queue"
      - undefined
      - Depends on queue implementation
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "Edge case: when one queue is empty, the two-pointer method simply dequeues from the non-empty queue. Result is [1, 2, 3]."

  - question: Merging [1, 2, 2] and [2, 3] with duplicates produces which result?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - "[1, 2, 2, 2, 3]"
      - "[1, 2, 2, 3]"
      - "[1, 2, 3]"
      - "Error: duplicates not allowed"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "Duplicates are handled naturally: when comparing 2 == 2, dequeue left 2 (or right 2), then compare again. Result includes all elements: [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]."
