  - question: Queue [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] rotated k=2 times results in what?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]"
      - "[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]"
      - "[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]"
      - "[5, 1, 2, 3, 4]"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "k=2 rotations: [1,2,3,4,5] → [2,3,4,5,1] → [3,4,5,1,2]."

  - question: For queue size n=5, rotating by k=7 is equivalent to rotating by what value?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "7"
      - "2"
      - "12"
      - "5"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Rotating n times returns to original. k % n = 7 % 5 = 2. Rotating 7 is same as rotating 2.

  - question: Why does array slicing values[k%n:] + values[:k%n] work for queue rotation?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - It's random and might work
      - It splits the array at the rotation point and recombines in the rotated order
      - It sorts the elements
      - It removes duplicates
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: values[k%n:] takes elements from position k%n to end. values[:k%n] takes from start to k%n. Concatenation achieves rotation in O(n).

  - question: What is the time complexity of a naive solution that simulates k dequeue-enqueue cycles?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(n)
      - O(k)
      - O(k) where k can be up to 10^9 - causes TLE
      - O(n log k)
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Simulating k operations when k can be 10^9 results in O(k) = O(10^9), which exceeds time limits. Modulo reduction converts to O(n).
