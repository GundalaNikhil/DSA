  - question: Rearranging [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] by alternating front and back gives which result?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "[1, 5, 2, 4, 3]"
      - "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]"
      - "[5, 1, 4, 2, 3]"
      - "[1, 2, 5, 4, 3]"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "Deque: take from front (1), then back (5), then front (2), then back (4), then front (3). Result: [1, 5, 2, 4, 3]."

  - question: "For a deque [a, b, c, d, e, f], what's the alternating pattern: front, back, front, ...?"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "[a, f, b, e, c, d]"
      - "[a, b, c, d, e, f]"
      - "[f, e, d, c, b, a]"
      - "[a, c, e, f, d, b]"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "Pattern: take front (a), take back (f), take front (b), take back (e), take front (c), take back (d). Result: [a, f, b, e, c, d]."

  - question: For an odd-length array like [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], how many times do you alternate before one operation succeeds but the other fails?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - 2 full alternations, then one more front pop
      - Exactly at the middle element
      - After 4 pops, 5 (middle) remains
      - Alternation continues until deque is empty
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Pop front (1), back (5), front (2), back (4), front (3). After 5 pops, deque is empty. The middle element (3) is popped last when only one element remains.

  - question: Why does a single equality check (deque size = 1) handle the odd-length edge case?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - It detects when the middle element is reached
      - It prevents index out of bounds errors
      - It ensures alternation stops gracefully
      - All of the above
    correct_answer: 3
    explanation: When deque.size() == 1, one element remains (the middle in odd-length arrays). Check this condition before popping to avoid empty deque errors. Handles odd/even uniformly.
