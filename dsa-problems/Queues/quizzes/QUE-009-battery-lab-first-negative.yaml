  - question: For array [12, -1, 7, 8, 15, -2] with window size 3, what is the first negative in window [12, -1, 7]?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "12"
      - "-1"
      - "0"
      - No negatives
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The first negative number in [12, -1, 7] is -1. When no negative exists, output 0.

  - question: After a window slides right and loses all its negative numbers, what should be output for that window?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - The previous window's negative
      - "0"
      - The largest element in the window
      - undefined
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: If a window contains no negative numbers, output 0 to indicate absence of negatives.

  - question: Why is storing only indices in the queue more efficient than storing values?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Indices take less memory than values
      - Index tracking enables lazy removal; front index always points to the first negative in the current window
      - Values can be negative and cause confusion
      - Indices allow direct access to original array
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Storing indices allows lazy deletion: when a window slides, outdated indices (outside window) remain in queue until checked, achieving O(n) instead of O(n*k)."

  - question: For array [12, -1, 7, 8, 15, -2] with window size 3, how do you efficiently check if front negative is still in current window?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Iterate through the queue from front to back
      - Compare front index with current window's left boundary
      - Re-scan the entire window for negatives
      - Use a heap to track all negatives
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: If front index < current window's start index, remove it (lazy deletion). Continue until front is valid or queue empties. This is O(n) amortized.
