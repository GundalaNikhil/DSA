  - question: After operations ENQUEUE 5, ENQUEUE 10, DEQUEUE, what is the FRONT of the queue?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "5"
      - "10"
      - EMPTY
      - Error
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: ENQUEUE 5 and 10 → queue is [5, 10]. DEQUEUE removes 5 (FIFO). FRONT returns 10.

  - question: What is the defining characteristic of a Queue data structure?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Last-In First-Out (LIFO)
      - First-In First-Out (FIFO)
      - Random access to any element
      - Sorted elements automatically
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Queues follow FIFO: the first element enqueued is the first to be dequeued, like a line at a service window."

  - question: Why is using list.pop(0) in Python naive for queue implementation?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - It returns the wrong element
      - It's O(n) because shifting all remaining elements is required after removal
      - It doesn't preserve FIFO order
      - It uses too much memory
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Removing from position 0 requires shifting all other elements, making each DEQUEUE O(n). Use collections.deque for O(1) popleft().

  - question: What is the time complexity of a properly implemented queue with O(1) ENQUEUE, DEQUEUE, FRONT?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(n) for all operations
      - O(1) per operation using pointer-based tracking or deque
      - O(log n) due to indexing
      - Depends on the number of elements
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A linked-list-based or deque-based queue maintains head/tail pointers, enabling O(1) amortized operations.
