  - question: "Queue [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] with k=2: reverse first 2, then rotate. Result is?"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]"
      - "[3, 4, 5, 2, 1]"
      - "[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]"
      - "[2, 1, 3, 4, 5]"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Reverse [1,2] → [2,1]. Queue: [2,1,3,4,5]. Rotate n-k=3 times: [3,4,5,2,1]."

  - question: What data structures are used to reverse the first k elements?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Only queue
      - Queue and stack
      - Two queues
      - Array and deque
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Dequeue first k to a stack, pop back to queue (LIFO reverses FIFO), then rotate the rest.

  - question: After reversing first k elements, why must we rotate the remaining n-k elements forward?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - To speed up the algorithm
      - Because reversed elements are at the back; rotation moves them to the front to match expected final position
      - To avoid repeating the reversal
      - It's optional
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Reversing first k leaves them at the back of the queue. n-k rotation cycles elements so reversed ones reach the correct position.

  - question: What is the total time complexity of this two-step algorithm?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(k) only
      - O(n) - reversing k elements + rotating n-k elements
      - O(n²)
      - O(k log k)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Reversing k: O(k). Rotating n-k: O(n-k). Total: O(n)."
