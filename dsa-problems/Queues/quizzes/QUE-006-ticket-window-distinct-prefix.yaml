questions:
  - question: "Stream 'aabac': first non-repeating at position 0 is 'a' (count 1). Position 2 is 'b' (count 1). Position 3 is?"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "'a'"
      - "'b'"
      - "'c'"
      - "'#'"
    correct_answer: 3
    explanation: "Position 3: 'a' count=2, 'b' count=1, 'c' count=1. Queue front is 'a' with count 2 (not 1), dequeue. Next is 'b' with count 1, but only 'c' remains in queue with count 1 too. Actually answer needs dynamic checking - output first with count 1 in queue."

  - question: What does lazy removal mean in this context?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Remove all elements at once
      - Never dequeue valid characters; only remove invalid ones from queue front when needed
      - Remove on a timer
      - Use no data structure
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Lazy removal keeps characters in queue until we know they're invalid (count > 1), then dequeue from front on-demand.

  - question: What is the space complexity for tracking character frequencies?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(n) where n is stream length
      - O(k) where k is alphabet size (≤26 for lowercase)
      - O(26) constant for lowercase letters
      - O(n²)
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Only 26 lowercase letters exist. Frequency map size is constant O(26), not dependent on stream length.

  - question: "When processing character c: increment frequency, enqueue, then check queue. Why not dequeue immediately if frequency > 1?"
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - It's the same effect
      - Because future characters might have frequency 1, pushing valid characters further back
      - Dequeuing immediately makes queue empty
      - There's no reason; both work equally
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Lazy dequeue from front only removes characters already proven invalid. This preserves FIFO order of valid candidates.
