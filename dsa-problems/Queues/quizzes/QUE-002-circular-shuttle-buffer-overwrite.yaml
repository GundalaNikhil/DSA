  - question: For circular buffer with capacity k=3 starting empty, after ENQ_OVR 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, what is REAR?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "1"
      - "3"
      - "5"
      - "4"
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: "ENQ_OVR keeps capacity fixed at 3. Final buffer is [3, 4, 5] (overwrote 1, 2). REAR is the last enqueued element: 5."

  - question: What distinguishes ENQ_OVR from regular ENQUEUE?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - ENQ_OVR is slower
      - ENQ_OVR overwrites the oldest element when buffer is full instead of failing
      - ENQ_OVR always deletes the newest element
      - ENQ_OVR reverses the queue
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: ENQ_OVR (enqueue with overwrite) discards the oldest element when full, allowing continuous insertion.

  - question: In a circular buffer, how do you distinguish between full and empty using head and tail pointers only?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - You can't without extra information
      - "Full: (tail + 1) % k == head. Empty: head == tail. Both conditions are mutually exclusive"
      - Full and empty are always the same condition
      - Use head < tail always
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "With an explicit count variable, you can avoid ambiguity: count == k means full, count == 0 means empty."

  - question: What is the time complexity of ENQ_OVR operation in a circular buffer of capacity k?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(k) because all elements must shift
      - O(1) - just update tail pointer and (if full) advance head pointer
      - O(log k) due to circular modulo arithmetic
      - O(n) where n is the number of elements
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: ENQ_OVR only updates pointers in O(1); the circular array structure prevents expensive shifts.
