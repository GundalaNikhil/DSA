  - question: Window [5, 5, 10] sorted has min=5, second min = ?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "5"
      - "10"
      - No second minimum
      - "7.5"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Multiple copies of the minimum value count separately in order. Second minimum is another 5.

  - question: What data structure efficiently maintains sorted window elements with counts?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Array
      - TreeMap or Multiset
      - Priority queue (heap)
      - Hash set
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: TreeMap/Multiset keeps elements sorted and supports O(log k) insert/delete. Heap doesn't support efficient arbitrary deletion.

  - question: In a TreeMap, if the smallest key has count > 1, what is the second minimum?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - The smallest key itself
      - The next largest key
      - Average of smallest and next
      - Error - second minimum doesn't exist
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Multiple copies of the minimum count as separate instances. If min appears k times, second min is still the same key.

  - question: When sliding the window, what operation is O(log k)?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Finding second minimum
      - Removing outgoing element from TreeMap
      - Adding incoming element
      - All of the above
    correct_answer: 3
    explanation: "TreeMap operations (insert, delete, search) are all O(log k). After update, finding second minimum is accessing second key: O(1) iteration."
