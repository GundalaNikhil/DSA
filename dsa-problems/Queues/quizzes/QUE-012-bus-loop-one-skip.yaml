questions:
  - question: For fuel = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and cost = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2], skipping which stop allows the bus to complete the loop starting at 0?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Stop 0
      - Stop 2
      - Stop 4
      - Cannot complete even with one skip
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: "At stop 0: gain = 1-3 = -2. At stop 1: -2+2-4 = -4. At stop 2: -4+3-5 = -6. At stop 3: -6+4-1 = -3. At stop 4: -3+5-2 = 0. Skip stop 2 (worst) or any stop to balance."

  - question: If total fuel collected > total cost to travel, can you always find a valid starting point with one skip?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Yes, always
      - No, never
      - Yes, if you skip the right station
      - Only sometimes
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: If total_fuel > total_cost, the problem is solvable. The greedy approach skips the stop with minimum gain (most negative contribution) to maximize chances.

  - question: Why does the algorithm try skipping the station with the minimum gain first?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - It's random and any skip works equally
      - Removing the worst contributor (minimum gain) is most likely to create a valid solution
      - It ensures optimal fuel efficiency
      - The problem requires skipping the worst station
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Greedy insight: if you can't complete the loop, identify the station where gain (fuel - cost) is minimum. Skipping it removes the worst deficit, most likely enabling a solution."

  - question: For fuel = [1, 2, 3] and cost = [1, 2, 3], what is total gain and can you complete with one skip?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Total gain = 0; no valid starting point even with skip
      - Total gain = 3; yes, start at 0
      - Total gain = 0; yes, any skip works
      - Total gain = -3; impossible
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Total gain = (1-1) + (2-2) + (3-3) = 0. No fuel surplus. Even skipping one stop leaves at least one other with negative gain. Cannot complete.
