  - question: After swapping two queues queueA = [1, 2, 3] and queueB = [4, 5], what is queueA?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "[1, 2, 3]"
      - "[4, 5]"
      - "[3, 2, 1, 5, 4]"
      - Undefined
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Queue swap exchanges the internal references. After swap, queueA points to the data previously held by queueB: [4, 5]. queueB now holds [1, 2, 3]."

  - question: What is the time complexity of swapping two queues?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(n) where n is the size of larger queue
      - O(n^2)
      - O(1) - just swap internal pointers
      - O(log n)
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Swap exchanges the internal data pointers of the queue objects. No element copying occurs. It's a constant-time operation.

  - question: If you swap two queues of different lengths [1, 2, 3] and [4, 5], does the operation still work correctly?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - No, queues must have equal length
      - Yes, the swap works regardless of length
      - No, the data structures are incompatible
      - Only if you resize first
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Swap operates on queue abstractions, not element counts. Different lengths are handled naturally. After swap, each queue references the other's data with its original length intact.

  - question: Why does this problem test understanding that 'queue is an abstraction' rather than concrete elements?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Because swap is trivial and doesn't require algorithm thinking
      - Because it demonstrates the difference between a queue's identity (reference) and its contents
      - Because it's a joke problem
      - Because swap is the only queue operation
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Swap reveals that a queue is a wrapper/abstraction around data. We don't swap elements; we swap the queue objects' internal pointers. This tests conceptual understanding of data structure abstraction.
