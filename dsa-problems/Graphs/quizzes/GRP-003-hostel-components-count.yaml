    points: 10
    options:
      - "0"
      - "1"
      - "2"
      - Depends on edges

  - question: For n=5 with edges (0,1) and (2,3), what is the number of connected components?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "2"
      - "3"
      - "4"
      - "5"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Components are {0,1}, {2,3}, and {4}, so total is 3.

  - question: When using DFS/BFS to count components, when do you increment the count?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - For every edge processed
      - For every node with degree > 0
      - Each time you start a traversal from an unvisited node
      - Only when node 0 is unvisited
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Each new traversal from an unvisited node marks a new component.

  - question: What is the time complexity of counting components with DFS/BFS?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(n)
      - O(n + m)
      - O(m log n)
      - O(n^2)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Each node and edge is visited at most once.
