  - question: What should be output if a cycle is detected?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "0"
      - "-1"
      - 1 0
      - "true"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A cycle means no valid ordering exists, so output -1.

  - question: If a valid ordering exists, what does the second number in the output represent?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - The total number of edges
      - The number of nodes with initial in-degree 0
      - The number of nodes processed last
      - The length of the longest path
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The count is the number of tasks with in-degree 0 before processing.

  - question: Using Kahn's algorithm, what indicates a cycle?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - The queue is initially empty
      - Processed nodes fewer than n
      - In-degrees are all positive
      - The graph is disconnected
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: If not all nodes are processed, some remain in a cycle.

  - question: What is the time complexity of Kahn's algorithm?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(n + m)
      - O(n log n)
      - O(m log n)
      - O(n^2)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Each node and edge is processed once.
