  - question: "In DFS with a recursion stack, encountering a node in the visiting state indicates:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - A cycle
      - A leaf
      - A tree edge
      - A disconnected component
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: A back edge to a visiting node indicates a directed cycle.

  - question: For edges 0->1, 1->2, 2->1, 2->3, what is the output?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "true"
      - "false"
      - depends on node order
      - invalid input
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Edges 1->2 and 2->1 form a directed cycle.

  - question: Using Kahn's algorithm, what does it mean if fewer than n nodes are processed?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - The graph is disconnected
      - A cycle exists
      - All nodes are reachable
      - The graph is bipartite
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Unprocessed nodes imply a cycle preventing a full topological ordering.

  - question: What is the time complexity of directed cycle detection with DFS or Kahn's algorithm?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(n)
      - O(n + m)
      - O(m log n)
      - O(n^2)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Both methods process nodes and edges linearly.
