  - question: In DFS for an undirected graph, when is a cycle detected?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - When a visited neighbor is not the parent
      - When a visited neighbor is the parent
      - When an unvisited neighbor is found
      - When a node has degree 1
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: A visited neighbor that is not the parent indicates a back edge and a cycle.

  - question: For edges (0,1), (1,2), (2,0), should the output be true or false?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "true"
      - "false"
      - depends on traversal order
      - invalid input
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The three edges form a triangle, which is a cycle.

  - question: What should be returned for a tree with n nodes and n-1 edges?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "true"
      - "false"
      - depends on n
      - only if n is even
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A tree has no cycles, so the answer is false.

  - question: What is the time complexity of undirected cycle detection with DFS?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(n)
      - O(n + m)
      - O(m log n)
      - O(n^2)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Each node and edge is visited at most once.
