  - question: What does it mean for a node to be reachable in this problem?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - It can be reached from any other node
      - It can be reached from node 0 using only edges with weight <= T
      - It has at least one outgoing edge
      - It is directly connected to node 0
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Reachability is defined as being able to reach a node from node 0 through edges with weight not exceeding the threshold T.

  - question: In the example with T=4, why is node 2 not reachable?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Node 2 is not in the graph
      - The edge from node 1 to node 2 has weight 7, which exceeds T=4
      - Node 2 is not connected to node 0
      - Node 0 is blocked by walls
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Even though node 2 exists and is connected to node 1, the edge (1,2) has weight 7 > 4, making it unusable.

  - question: What approach uses Union-Find to solve this problem efficiently?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Sort edges by weight and union nodes connected by edges with weight <= T, then find component size of node 0
      - Create a minimum spanning tree and traverse it
      - Union all edges regardless of weight and count components
      - Perform Dijkstra's algorithm from node 0
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Sort edges by weight, then union pairs connected by valid edges, and finally return the size of the component containing node 0.

  - question: What is the time complexity for the BFS/DFS approach?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(m log m)
      - O(n + m)
      - O(n × m)
      - O(m^2)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: BFS/DFS visits each node and edge at most once, giving O(n + m) time complexity.
