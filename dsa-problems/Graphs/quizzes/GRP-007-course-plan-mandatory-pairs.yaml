      - "0"
      - empty list
      - "false"
    correct_answer: 0

  - question: What does a mandatory pair (u, v) require?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - u must come before v
      - v must come before u
      - u and v must be adjacent in any order
      - u and v must be in different components
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Mandatory pairs must appear next to each other in the final schedule.

  - question: "A common approach to enforce adjacency pairs is to:"
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Ignore the pairs during sorting
      - Contract each pair into a super-node and topologically sort
      - Sort by course number
      - Run BFS from node 0
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Contracting pairs reduces the problem to topological sorting of super-nodes.

  - question: What is the time complexity of the approach using contraction and topological sort?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(n + m)
      - O(n + m + p)
      - O(n^2)
      - O(m log n)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: You process edges and pairs once, giving O(n + m + p).
