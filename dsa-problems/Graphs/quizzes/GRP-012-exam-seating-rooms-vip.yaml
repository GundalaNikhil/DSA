  - question: What is the core constraint in this problem?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Each component must have at least one VIP
      - No component may contain more than one VIP
      - VIPs must be isolated nodes
      - VIPs must be adjacent
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Components cannot contain more than one VIP.

  - question: When processing an edge (u, v), what should you do if both components already contain a VIP?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Always union them
      - Skip the edge
      - Remove both VIPs
      - Add a new VIP
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Union would violate the constraint, so the edge is skipped.

  - question: What should be output after enforcing the VIP constraint?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - The number of VIPs
      - The size of the largest remaining component
      - The total number of edges removed
      - The size of the smallest component
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The task asks for the largest component size after removals.

  - question: What is the time complexity of the Union-Find approach?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(n)
      - O(m log n)
      - O(m * alpha(n))
      - O(n^2)
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: DSU operations are nearly constant, giving O(m * alpha(n)).
