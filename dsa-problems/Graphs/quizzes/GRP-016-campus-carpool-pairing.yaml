  - question: What does it mean for a graph to be a forest?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - It is connected and has cycles
      - It has no cycles
      - It has exactly one component
      - Every node has degree 2
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A forest is an acyclic undirected graph; isolated nodes are allowed.

  - question: In Union-Find cycle detection, when do you conclude the graph is not a forest?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - When an edge connects two nodes in different sets
      - When an edge connects two nodes already in the same set
      - When a node has degree 0
      - When m < n
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: An edge within the same set forms a cycle.

  - question: What can be concluded if an undirected graph has m >= n edges?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - It must be a forest
      - It must contain a cycle
      - It has no edges
      - It is a tree
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A forest on n nodes has at most n-1 edges, so m >= n implies a cycle.

  - question: For n=3 with edges (0,1) and (1,2), what should be returned?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "true"
      - "false"
      - depends on traversal
      - invalid input
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The graph is a simple path and has no cycles.
