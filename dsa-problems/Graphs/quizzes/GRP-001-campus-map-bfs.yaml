  - question: In the given problem, if the graph is disconnected and node 0 is in a component with 5 nodes, how many nodes will appear in the BFS traversal output?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - All n nodes
      - Only 5 nodes (those reachable from node 0)
      - Only node 0
      - It depends on the total number of edges
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: BFS only visits nodes reachable from the starting node. If node 0 is in a component with 5 nodes, only those 5 nodes will be visited and appear in the output, regardless of other disconnected components.

  - question: What determines the order in which nodes at the same level are visited during BFS?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - The node values (smaller values first)
      - Random order
      - The order in which neighbors appear in the adjacency list
      - Alphabetical order of node labels
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: The order of visitation within a level is determined by the order in which neighbors appear in the adjacency list. When we process a node, we enqueue its neighbors in the order they appear in adj[node].

  - question: Given a graph with n=5 nodes and m=0 edges, what will be the BFS traversal output starting from node 0?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - 0 1 2 3 4
      - "0"
      - Empty output
      - Error - invalid graph
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: With no edges, node 0 is isolated and has no neighbors. BFS will only visit node 0 itself, so the output is just '0'. Other nodes are unreachable from node 0.

  - question: Which of the following statements are true about the BFS traversal in this problem? (Select all that apply)
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Nodes at distance k from the source are visited before nodes at distance k+1
      - The graph must be connected for BFS to work
      - Each reachable node is visited exactly once
      - BFS can detect cycles in the graph
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: A is true - BFS visits nodes level by level. B is false - BFS works on disconnected graphs but only visits the component containing the source. C is true - the visited array ensures each node is visited once. D is false while BFS can be modified to detect cycles, the basic traversal doesn't explicitly do this.
