  - question: In preorder DFS, when is a node recorded?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - When it is first visited
      - After all its neighbors are processed
      - Only when it is popped from the stack
      - Only if it has no unvisited neighbors
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Preorder records a node at the moment it is first visited.

  - question: For n=5 with edges (0,1), (0,2), (1,4), what is the DFS preorder starting from 0 (using adjacency list order as given)?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - 0 2 1 4
      - 0 1 4 2
      - 0 1 2 4
      - 0 4 1 2
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: DFS goes 0 -> 1 -> 4, then backtracks to visit 2.

  - question: If n=3 and m=0, what is the DFS preorder output starting from node 0?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "0"
      - 0 1 2
      - 1 2
      - empty output
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: With no edges, only node 0 is reachable.

  - question: What is the time complexity of DFS on a graph with n nodes and m edges?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(n)
      - O(n + m)
      - O(m log n)
      - O(n^2)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: DFS visits each node and edge at most once.
