questions:
  - question: Which edges are allowed in a valid path?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Only edges with weight < B
      - Only edges with weight <= B
      - Only edges with weight >= B
      - All edges
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: An edge can be traversed only if its weight is <= B.

  - question: For the sample input in the statement, what is the minimum valid cost?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "30"
      - "35"
      - "40"
      - "55"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The valid path 0->1->2->3 has total cost 35.

  - question: Which modification to Dijkstra solves this problem?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Ignore edge weights
      - Skip edges with weight > B during relaxation
      - Use BFS instead
      - Sort nodes by degree
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Filtering out heavy edges reduces the problem to standard Dijkstra.

  - question: What is the time complexity of the filtered Dijkstra approach?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(n + m)
      - O((n + m) log n)
      - O(n^2)
      - O(m log m)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The algorithm still runs Dijkstra with heap operations.
