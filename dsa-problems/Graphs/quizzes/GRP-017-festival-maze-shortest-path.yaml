questions:
  - question: What does the state (row, col, visited_food) represent in BFS?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Current position and number of food stalls visited
      - Current position and whether at least one food stall has been visited
      - Distance to nearest food stall
      - Total steps taken so far
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The state tracks position and whether we've visited at least one food stall (0 or 1).

  - question: Why is a state-based BFS necessary instead of standard BFS?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - To find the shortest path in weighted graphs
      - To enforce the constraint of visiting at least one food stall before reaching the exit
      - To handle cycles in the grid
      - To optimize space complexity
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The constraint that we must visit food before exiting requires tracking whether this condition is met.

  - question: In the given example, can we reach the exit from start without visiting any food stall?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - "Yes"
      - "No"
      - It depends on the grid size
      - It depends on the number of walls
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The problem explicitly requires visiting at least one food stall before reaching the exit.

  - question: What is the space complexity of the state space for a grid of size r × c?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(r × c)
      - O(r × c × 2)
      - O(r + c)
      - O(2^(r × c))
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: We have r × c positions and 2 possible values for visited_food (0 or 1), giving O(r × c × 2) states.
