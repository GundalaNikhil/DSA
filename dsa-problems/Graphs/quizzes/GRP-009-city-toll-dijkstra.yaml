  - question: What restriction on edge weights is required for Dijkstra's algorithm?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Weights must be non-negative
      - Weights must be non-positive
      - Weights must be all equal
      - Weights must be prime
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Dijkstra's algorithm assumes non-negative weights to be correct.

  - question: What is the time complexity of Dijkstra with a binary heap?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(n + m)
      - O((n + m) log n)
      - O(n^2)
      - O(m log m)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Each heap operation is log n, applied to nodes and edges.
