  - question: Which algorithm is used to find shortest paths in an unweighted graph?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - DFS
      - BFS
      - Dijkstra
      - Bellman-Ford
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: BFS explores in layers and gives shortest paths by edge count.

  - question: For the sample input in the statement, what is the output?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - 0 1 2 1 2
      - 0 1 1 2 2
      - 0 2 1 1 2
      - 0 1 2 2 1

  - question: What is the time complexity of BFS on a graph with n nodes and m edges?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(n)
      - O(n + m)
      - O(m log n)
      - O(n^2)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: BFS visits each node and edge at most once.
