questions:
  - question: In the locked array, what does value 0 mean?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Force group A
      - Force group B
      - Unlocked
      - Invalid
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Value 0 means the node is not pre-colored and can be assigned either group.

  - question: Which structure makes a graph non-bipartite (ignoring locks)?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Even cycle
      - Odd cycle
      - Tree
      - Disconnected acyclic graph
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: An odd-length cycle cannot be two-colored.

  - question: If a locked node conflicts with the color required by BFS/DFS, what should the algorithm do?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Ignore the lock
      - Recolor the neighbor
      - Return false
      - Skip the edge
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: A lock conflict makes the coloring impossible, so return false.

  - question: What is the time complexity of the bipartite check across all components?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(n + m)
      - O(n log n)
      - O(n^2)
      - O(m log n)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Each node and edge is processed once in BFS/DFS.
