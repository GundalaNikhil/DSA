questions:
  - question: When is a DFS root an articulation point?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - If it has at least one child
      - If it has two or more DFS children
      - If it has no children
      - Only if it is part of a cycle
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A root with 2+ DFS children separates those subtrees when removed.

  - question: For a non-root node u, which condition makes u an articulation point?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - low[v] >= disc[u] for some child v
      - low[v] < disc[u] for all children v
      - disc[u] == 0
      - u has degree 1
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: If no back edge from v's subtree reaches above u, removing u disconnects.

  - question: What is the time complexity of Tarjan's articulation point algorithm?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(n)
      - O(n + m)
      - O(m log n)
      - O(n^2)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The DFS visits each node and edge once.
