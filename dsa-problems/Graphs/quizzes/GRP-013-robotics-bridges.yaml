  - question: What is a bridge in an undirected graph?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - An edge whose removal increases connected components
      - A node connected to all others
      - A cycle of length 2
      - An edge inside a triangle
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Removing a bridge disconnects the graph or a component.

  - question: In Tarjan's algorithm, when is an edge (u, v) a bridge (v is a DFS child of u)?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - low[v] >= disc[u]
      - low[v] > disc[u]
      - low[v] == disc[v]
      - low[v] <= disc[u]
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The strict inequality low[v] > disc[u] indicates no back edge from v's subtree.

  - question: How many bridges exist in a simple cycle graph?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "0"
      - "1"
      - "2"
      - All edges
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Every edge is part of a cycle, so none are bridges.

  - question: What is the time complexity of finding bridges with Tarjan's algorithm?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(n)
      - O(n + m)
      - O(m log n)
      - O(n^2)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: DFS visits each node and edge once.
