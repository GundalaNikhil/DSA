# GRP-004: Seminar Bipartite Check with Locked Nodes

## 📋 Problem Summary

Determine if an undirected graph can be 2-colored (bipartite) while respecting pre-colored (locked) nodes. Some nodes are locked to specific colors (group A or B), and we must check if a valid bipartite coloring exists that satisfies all constraints.

## 🌍 Real-World Scenario

**Scenario Title:** Seminar Room Assignment with VIP Seating

Imagine organizing a university seminar where students must be divided into two discussion groups (A and B). Some students have conflicts and cannot be in the same group (represented by edges). Additionally, certain VIP students or faculty are pre-assigned to specific groups and cannot be moved.

The challenge is to assign remaining students to groups such that no two connected students are in the same group, while respecting the locked assignments. This is a constrained bipartite checking problem - we need to verify if such an assignment is possible.

For example, if two VIP students who have a conflict are both locked to group A, no valid assignment exists. However, if they're locked to different groups or if there's flexibility in other assignments, a solution might be possible.

**Why This Problem Matters:**

- **Scheduling with Constraints:** Assigning shifts/tasks with pre-existing commitments
- **Resource Allocation:** Distributing resources with fixed assignments
- **Conflict Resolution:** Managing incompatible requirements with locked constraints
- **Seating Arrangements:** Event planning with VIP or reserved seating

## Detailed Explanation

### ASCII Diagram: Bipartite with Locked Nodes

```
Graph (cycle of 4 nodes):

    0 --- 1
    |     |
    3 --- 2

Locked array: [1, 0, 0, 2]
- Node 0: Locked to group A (1)
- Node 1: Unlocked (0)
- Node 2: Unlocked (0)
- Node 3: Locked to group B (2)

Valid coloring:
Node 0: A (locked)
Node 1: B (must differ from 0)
Node 2: A (must differ from 1)
Node 3: B (locked, must differ from 2) ✓

This is valid because:
- 0-1 edge: A-B ✓
- 1-2 edge: B-A ✓
- 2-3 edge: A-B ✓
- 3-0 edge: B-A ✓

Legend:
A = Group A (color 1)
B = Group B (color 2)
0 = Unlocked (can be either)
```

## ✅ Input/Output Clarifications (Read This Before Coding)

- **Locked values:** 0 = unlocked, 1 = locked to group A, 2 = locked to group B
- **Bipartite property:** No two adjacent nodes can have the same color
- **Conflict detection:** If a locked node's required color conflicts with its forced color, return false
- **Disconnected components:** Handle each component separately
- **Color assignment:** Unlocked nodes get colored based on their neighbors

Common interpretation mistake:

- ❌ **Wrong:** Ignoring locked constraints and just checking standard bipartite
- ✅ **Correct:** Respecting locked nodes and checking if coloring is still possible

### Core Concept

Use BFS/DFS for graph coloring. When visiting a node:
1. If it's locked, check if the required color matches the locked color
2. If unlocked, assign the opposite color of its parent
3. If there's a conflict, return false

## Naive Approach

### Intuition

Perform standard bipartite checking but add validation for locked nodes at each step.

### Algorithm

1. Create color array initialized to -1 (uncolored)
2. For locked nodes, set color[i] = locked[i]
3. For each unvisited node:
   - Start BFS/DFS with appropriate color
   - For each neighbor:
     - If uncolored: assign opposite color
     - If colored: check if it's the opposite color
     - If locked: verify the assignment matches the lock
4. Return true if no conflicts, false otherwise

### Time Complexity

- **O(V + E)** - Visit each node and edge once

### Space Complexity

- **O(V)** - For color array and BFS queue

### Why This Works

Standard bipartite checking with additional locked node validation ensures we respect pre-existing constraints while maintaining the bipartite property.

## Optimal Approach

### Key Insight

The naive approach is optimal. The key is to handle locked nodes carefully during BFS/DFS traversal.

### Algorithm

```
can_color_bipartite(n, adj, locked):
    color = [-1] * n
    
    # Pre-color locked nodes
    for i in 0 to n-1:
        if locked[i] != 0:
            color[i] = locked[i]
    
    for i in 0 to n-1:
        if color[i] == -1:
            if not bfs(i, adj, color, locked):
                return false
    
    return true

bfs(start, adj, color, locked):
    queue = [start]
    color[start] = 1 if locked[start] == 0 else locked[start]
    
    while queue not empty:
        node = queue.dequeue()
        required_neighbor_color = 3 - color[node]  // Toggle between 1 and 2
        
        for neighbor in adj[node]:
            if color[neighbor] == -1:
                color[neighbor] = required_neighbor_color
                queue.enqueue(neighbor)
            elif color[neighbor] != required_neighbor_color:
                return false  // Conflict detected
    
    return true
```

### Time Complexity

- **O(V + E)** - Optimal for graph traversal

### Space Complexity

- **O(V)** - For color array and queue

## Implementations

### Java


### Python


### C++


### JavaScript


## 🧪 Test Case Walkthrough (Dry Run)

Use the sample:
- n = 4, m = 4
- Edges: (0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,0)
- Locked: [1, 0, 0, 2]

Graph forms a cycle: 0-1-2-3-0

Initialize locked colors:
- color = [1, -1, -1, 2]

Start BFS from locked node 0:
- Node 1 must be 2 (opposite of 0)
- Node 2 must be 1 (opposite of 1)
- Node 3 must be 2 (opposite of 2), and it matches the lock ✓

Answer: `true`

## ✅ Proof of Correctness

### Invariant

At any point, all colored nodes satisfy: (1) bipartite property with neighbors, (2) locked constraints.

### Why the approach is correct

**Bipartite checking:** Standard BFS 2-coloring ensures no adjacent nodes have the same color.

**Locked validation:** Before coloring a node, we verify it's not locked to a conflicting color.

**Completeness:** We check all components, ensuring no part of the graph is missed.

## 💡 Interview Extensions (High-Value Add-ons)

- **Extension 1:** Return a valid coloring if one exists, not just true/false
- **Extension 2:** Find the minimum number of locked nodes to change to make bipartite coloring possible
- **Extension 3:** Handle 3-coloring with locked nodes
- **Extension 4:** Count the number of valid colorings respecting locks

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Ignoring Locked Constraints**

   - ❌ Wrong: Standard bipartite check without validating locked nodes
   - ✅ Correct: Check locked constraints at every coloring step
   - **Impact:** Incorrect results when locks conflict with bipartite property

2. **Wrong Color Toggle Logic**

   - ❌ Wrong: Using `1 - color[node]` for toggling between 1 and 2
   - ✅ Correct: Using `3 - color[node]` to toggle between 1 and 2
   - **Description:** Math error in color calculation

3. **Not Pre-Coloring Locked Nodes**

   - ❌ Wrong: Coloring locked nodes during BFS
   - ✅ Correct: Pre-color all locked nodes before starting BFS
   - **Prevention:** Ensures locked constraints are respected from the start

4. **Forgetting Disconnected Components**

   - ❌ Wrong: Only checking from node 0
   - ✅ Correct: Check all unvisited nodes to handle disconnected components
   - **Description:** Missing components leads to incomplete validation

5. **Incorrect Conflict Detection**

   - ❌ Wrong: Only checking color conflicts, not locked conflicts
   - ✅ Correct: Check both: (1) color[neighbor] matches required, (2) locked[neighbor] allows required color
   - **Description:** Missing one type of conflict gives wrong answer
