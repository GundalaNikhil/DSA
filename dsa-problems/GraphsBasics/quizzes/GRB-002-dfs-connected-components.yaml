  - question: For a graph with nodes 0..4 and edges (0,1), (3,4), how many connected components are there?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "1"
      - "2"
      - "3"
      - "5"
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Components are {0,1}, {2}, {3,4}. Total 3 components.

  - question: In the connected components algorithm, when is the DFS function called?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - For every node in the graph
      - For every unvisited node in the main loop
      - Only for the first node
      - For every edge
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: We iterate 0 to N-1 and call DFS only if the node is not yet visited, identifying a new component.

    question: Which data structure is naturally used to implement recursion in DFS?
    options:
      - Queue
      - Stack
      - Heap
      - Map
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: DFS uses a Stack (either explicitly or via the system call stack in recursion).

    question: What is the worst-case space complexity of recursive DFS?
    options:
      - O(1)
      - O(N) for the recursion stack
      - O(M)
      - O(N^2)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: In a degenerate 'line' graph, DFS recursion depth reaches N.
