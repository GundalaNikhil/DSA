questions:
  - question: What is the main benefit of Path Compression?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Reduces memory usage
      - Flattens the tree structure, making future finds faster
      - Eliminates recursion
      - Sorts the elements
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Path compression attaches nodes directly to the root, making tree height small.

  - question: What is the amortized time complexity of DSU operations with path compression and union by rank?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(log N)
      - O(N)
      - O(alpha(N))
      - O(1)
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Alpha(N) is the inverse Ackermann function, which is nearly constant (< 5 for all practical N).

  - question: Initially, what is the parent of each node in DSU?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "-1"
      - "0"
      - The node itself
      - "Null"
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Each node starts in its own set, so parent[i] = i.

    question: What is the amortized complexity of DSU operations with path compression and union by rank?
    options:
      - O(1)
      - O(log N)
      - O(alpha(N))
      - O(N)
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Alpha(N) is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows extremely slowly (nearly O(1)).
