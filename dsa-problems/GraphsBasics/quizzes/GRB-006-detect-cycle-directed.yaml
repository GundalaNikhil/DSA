questions:
  - question: In DFS cycle detection, what does a 'back edge' point to?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - A node in the recursion stack
      - A node that has finished processing
      - An unvisited node
      - A leaf node
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: An edge to a node currently in the recursion stack indicates a cycle.

  - question: Using the 3-color method, what does color 1 (Gray/Visiting) represent?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Node is unvisited
      - Node is currently being visited (in recursion stack)
      - Node and all its descendants are processed
      - Node is part of a cycle
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Color 1 means we are currently visiting this node or its descendants.

  - question: What is the time complexity to detect a cycle in a directed graph?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(N)
      - O(N + M)
      - O(N * M)
      - O(M^2)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: It's essentially a DFS traversal, so O(N + M).

  - id: edq_3
    type: single_choice
    difficulty: hard

    question: In DFS-based cycle detection for directed graphs, what state indicates a cycle?
    options:
      - Visiting a node already marked 'visited'
      - Visiting a node currently in the 'recursion stack'
      - Reaching a sink
      - Visiting all edges
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A back-edge to an ancestor in the current recursion stack confirms a cycle.
