  - question: What is the most efficient way to find shortest paths in a DAG?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Dijkstra's Algorithm
      - Bellman-Ford Algorithm
      - Process nodes in Topological Order
      - BFS
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Relaxing edges in topological order ensures we process each node with its final shortest distance in O(N+M).

  - question: Does the Topological Sort approach work with negative edge weights in a DAG?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - "Yes"
      - "No"
      - Only if no negative cycles exist
      - Only for integer weights
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Since it's a DAG, there are no cycles (negative or otherwise), so the DP-like relaxation works perfectly.

  - question: What is the time complexity of finding the Longest Path in a DAG?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - NP-Hard
      - O(N + M)
      - O(N^2)
      - O(2^N)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Unlike general graphs, Longest Path in a DAG is linear, solved same as Shortest Path but maximizing weights.

  - id: edq_3
    type: single_choice
    difficulty: hard
    points: 20
    question: Why can shortest paths in a DAG be found in O(N + M)?
    options:
      - Because DAGs are basically trees
      - Because we can process nodes in topological order
      - Because there are no edges
      - Because weights are always 1
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Topological order ensures we compute distance to a node only after its predecessors are finalized.
