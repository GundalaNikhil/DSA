  - question: What defines a Bridge in a graph?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - An edge connecting two high-degree nodes
      - An edge whose removal increases the number of connected components
      - The longest edge in the graph
      - An edge part of a cycle
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A bridge is a critical connection; removing it splits the graph/component.

  - question: What is the condition for edge u-v to be a bridge?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - low[v] > disc[u]
      - low[v] >= disc[u]
      - low[v] == disc[u]
      - low[v] < disc[u]
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The strict inequality means v has no back-edge to u or above, so u-v is the only path to v.

  - question: Can a bridge be part of a cycle?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "Yes"
      - "No"
      - Only in directed graphs
      - Only in weighted graphs
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: If an edge is part of a cycle, removing it leaves the other path of the cycle, keeping connectivity.

    question: Is it possible for an edge to be a bridge but neither of its endpoints to be articulation points?
    options:
      - Yes, always
      - No, if n > 2
      - Only in trees
      - Only in disconnected graphs
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: For N>2, removing a bridge edge separates the graph, and removing one of its endpoints (connected to other nodes) also disconnects it.
