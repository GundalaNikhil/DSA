questions:
  - question: If Bellman-Ford can still relax an edge after N-1 iterations, what does it imply?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - The graph is disconnected
      - There is a negative weight cycle reachable from source
      - The shortest path has exactly N edges
      - The algorithm needs one more iteration to finish
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Changes after N-1 iterations indicate a negative cycle allowing infinite reduction of distance.

  - question: What is the time complexity of Bellman-Ford algorithm?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(N + M)
      - O(M log N)
      - O(N * M)
      - O(N^3)
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: We relax all M edges N-1 times, leading to O(N * M) complexity.

    question: For a graph with N nodes, what is the maximum number of edge relaxation passes Bellman-Ford performs?
    options:
      - N
      - N - 1
      - M
      - log N
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Shortest paths in a graph without negative cycles have at most N-1 edges, so N-1 passes are sufficient.

    question: How many iterations of edge relaxation are sufficient for Bellman-Ford in a graph with N nodes?
    options:
      - N
      - N-1
      - M
      - log N
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A simple shortest path contains at most N-1 edges.
