questions:
  - question: In 2-SAT, the clause (A OR B) is equivalent to which implications?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - NOT A -> B and NOT B -> A
      - A -> B and B -> A
      - A -> NOT B and B -> NOT A
      - NOT A -> NOT B
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: If A is false, B *must* be true for the clause to be satisfied, and vice-versa.

  - question: A 2-SAT instance is unsatisfiable if specifically which condition is met?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - A variable X and NOT X are in the same Strongly Connected Component (SCC)
      - The implication graph has a cycle
      - There are more clauses than variables
      - A variable X implies NOT X
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: If X and NOT X are in the same SCC, it means X -> ... -> NOT X -> ... -> X, which is a contradiction.

  - question: To convert 'At Most One of {A, B, C} is true' to 2-SAT clauses, how many clauses are needed naively?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(N)
      - O(N^2)
      - O(1)
      - O(log N)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: We need to say (NOT A or NOT B), (NOT A or NOT C), (NOT B or NOT C), which is N*(N-1)/2 pairs.

    question: In the implication graph for 2-SAT, how many nodes are there for N variables?
    options:
      - N
      - 2N
      - M
      - N^2
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Each variable X has two literals: X and not-X."
