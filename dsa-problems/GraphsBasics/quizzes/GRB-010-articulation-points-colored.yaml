questions:
  - question: For the root of the DFS tree, when is it an articulation point?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Always
      - Never
      - If it has more than 1 child in the DFS tree
      - If it has edges to leaf nodes
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Removing the root disconnects its children subtrees if there are >1 independent children.

  - question: What is the condition for a non-root node u to be an articulation point?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - low[child] >= disc[u]
      - low[child] > disc[u]
      - low[child] < disc[u]
      - disc[child] == low[u]
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: If a child cannot reach an ancestor of u (low >= disc[u]), removing u disconnects that child.

  - question: What do 'disc' and 'low' arrays represent?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Distance and Lowest common ancestor
      - Discovery time and Lowest discovery time reachable via back-edge
      - Distinct nodes and Lower bound
      - Diameter and Lower capacity
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Disc is when a node is first visited; Low is the earliest visited node reachable from the subtree.

    question: In a DFS tree, when is the root considered an articulation point?
    options:
      - If it has at least one child
      - If it has more than one child
      - If it is part of a cycle
      - Always
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A root is an articulation point if it has 2 or more children in the DFS tree, as removing it disconnects those child subtrees.
