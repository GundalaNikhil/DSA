questions:
  - question: In Kahn's algorithm, which nodes are added to the queue initially?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Nodes with out-degree 0
      - Nodes with in-degree 0
      - Nodes with in-degree 1
      - Arbitrary nodes
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Nodes with in-degree 0 have no dependencies and can be processed first.
    type: single_choice
    id: prq_1
  - question: If the topological sort output has fewer than N nodes, what does it imply?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - The graph is disconnected
      - The graph has a cycle
      - The graph is a tree
      - The start node was incorrect
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: If we cannot process all nodes, there is a cycle preventing some in-degrees from becoming 0.

  - question: Topological Sort is applicable to which type of graphs?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Undirected Cyclic Graphs
      - Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)
      - Any Directed Graph
      - Weighted Graphs only
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Topo sort is only defined for Directed Acyclic Graphs.

  - id: edq_3

    question: What is the condition for a graph to have a valid topological sort?
    options:
      - It must be connected
      - It must be a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)
      - It must have a source and a sink
      - It must be undirected
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Cycles prevent a linear ordering where all edges point forward.
