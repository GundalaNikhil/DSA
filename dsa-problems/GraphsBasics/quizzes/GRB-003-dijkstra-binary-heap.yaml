  - question: Given edges (0,1,10), (0,2,5), (2,1,2), what is the shortest distance from 0 to 1?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "10"
      - "5"
      - "7"
      - "2"
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Path 0->2->1 has cost 5 + 2 = 7, which is less than direct edge 10.

  - question: Why does Dijkstra's algorithm fail with negative edge weights?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - The Priority Queue cannot handle negative numbers
      - Greedy assumption that 'reaching a node with smaller dist is final' breaks
      - It causes an infinite loop
      - Complexity becomes exponential
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Dijkstra assumes once a node is popped from PQ, its optimal distance is found. Negative edges can invalidate this.

  - question: What is the time complexity of Dijkstra using a Binary Heap?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(N^2)
      - O(M log N)
      - O(N + M)
      - O(M * N)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Each edge is relaxed once, and PQ operations take log N. Total O(M log N).

    type: single_choice
    difficulty: hard
    points: 20
    question: Why does Dijkstra's algorithm assume non-negative weights?
    options:
      - Negative weights cause infinite loops
      - It may finalized a distance too early that could be reduced by a negative edge
      - Heaps don't support negative numbers
      - It is for directed graphs only
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Dijkstra finalizes a node's distance when it's extracted from the heap. Negative edges can provide a 'shortcut' later, invalidating this.
