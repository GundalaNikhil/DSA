  - question: In the Euler Tour flattening technique (Subtree Ranges), what property holds for a subtree of u?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - It corresponds to a contiguous subarray from tin[u] to tout[u]
      - All nodes in the subtree are adjacent in the original array
      - The subtree size is tout[u] - tin[u] - 1
      - Nodes are sorted by value
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: DFS entry and exit times map any subtree to a contiguous range [tin[u], tout[u]].

  - question: How can we check if node u is an ancestor of node v in O(1)?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - tin[u] <= tin[v] and tout[u] >= tout[v]
      - tin[u] < tin[v]
      - tout[u] > tout[v]
      - depth[u] < depth[v]
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: u is an ancestor if we enter u before v and leave u after v.

  - question: What is the size of the 'tin' array required for this technique?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - N
      - 2N
      - N^2
      - Log N
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We assign one unique entry time per node, so size N is sufficient.

    question: What is the purpose of re-flattening a tree via an Euler Tour?
    options:
      - To convert subtrees into contiguous array segments
      - To find the root
      - To sort the nodes
      - To reduce memory
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Euler tour allows subtree queries to be handled as range queries on an array.
