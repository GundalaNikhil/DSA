  - question: "Floyd-Warshall computes shortest paths between:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Single source to all destinations
      - All pairs of nodes
      - Single pair of nodes
      - MST nodes
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: It computes the shortest distance between every pair of vertices (u, v).

  - question: What is the core state transition `dist[i][j]` in Floyd-Warshall?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j])
      - min(dist[i][j], dist[k][i] + dist[j][k])
      - dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]
      - 2 * dist[i][j]
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We try to relax the path from i to j by going through an intermediate node k.

    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(N^3)
      - O(M^3)
      - O(N^2 log N)
      - O(N * M)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Three nested loops for k, i, j each running N times.
