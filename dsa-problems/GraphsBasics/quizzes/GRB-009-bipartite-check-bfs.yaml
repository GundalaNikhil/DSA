questions:
  - question: A graph is bipartite if and only if it contains no cycle of what length?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Odd
      - Even
      - Length 3 specifically
      - Any length
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: An odd cycle forces a node to be the same color as its neighbor, violating bipartiteness.

  - question: In BFS coloring, if we encounter a visited neighbor with the same color, what does it mean?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - The graph is bipartite
      - The graph is not bipartite
      - We found a bridge
      - We must restart BFS
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Same color neighbors imply an odd cycle exists, so not bipartite.

  - question: Can a disconnected graph be bipartite?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Yes, if every component is bipartite
      - "No"
      - Only if it has no edges
      - Only if it has 2 components
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Bipartite property applies to each connected component independently.

    question: A graph is bipartite if and only if it contains no ________.
    options:
      - Even cycles
      - Odd cycles
      - Self-loops
      - Bridges
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Odd cycles require at least 3 colors to avoid same-color neighbors.
