  - question: What is the first step in Kruskal's algorithm?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Pick an arbitrary start node
      - Sort all edges by weight in ascending order
      - Calculate shortest paths
      - Initialize distance array
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Kruskal's processes edges from smallest weight to largest.

  - question: Which data structure is efficient for checking cycles in Kruskal's?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - DFS/BFS
      - Disjoint Set Union (DSU)
      - Priority Queue
      - Adjacency Matrix
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: DSU allows near-constant time checking if two nodes are already connected.

  - question: If a graph has N nodes, how many edges will the MST have?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - N
      - N - 1
      - N + 1
      - M
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A tree with N nodes always has exactly N-1 edges.

  - id: edq_3
    type: single_choice
    difficulty: hard

    question: Why does Kruskal's algorithm sort edges by weight?
    options:
      - To use binary search
      - To greedily pick the smallest edges first (Greedy Property)
      - To avoid using DSU
      - To handle negative weights
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Kruskal's is a greedy algorithm that builds the MST by picking the smallest available edges that don't form a cycle.
