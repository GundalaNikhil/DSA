  - question: In Prim's algorithm, what does the Priority Queue store?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Edges sorted by weight
      - Nodes and their current minimum weight to the MST
      - Nodes ordered by degree
      - Cumulative distance from source
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: It stores pairs (weight, node) representing the cheapest edge to connect the node to the MST.

  - question: Prim's algorithm is most efficient for which type of graph?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Sparse graphs
      - Dense graphs
      - Trees
      - Disconnected graphs
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: For dense graphs, Prim's (O(N^2) or O(M log N)) is often better than Kruskal's (O(M log M)) as M can be N^2.

  - question: What logic ensures the correctness of Prim's?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Cut Property
      - Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
      - Triangle Inequality
      - Pigeonhole Principle
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The Cut Property states that the minimum weight edge crossing any cut must be part of the MST.

    question: What is the time complexity of Prim's algorithm using a binary heap?
    options:
      - O(N + M)
      - O(M log N)
      - O(N^2)
      - O(M log M)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Each edge is processed and potentially updated in the priority queue, taking O(log N) per edge.
