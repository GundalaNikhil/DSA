# Expression Target With One Negation Flip - Editorial

## Problem Summary

You are given a string of digits `s`. You need to insert `+` or `-` operators between digits to form an expression. Additionally, you can choose **at most one** operand chunk and negate it (flip its sign). The total number of binary operators (`+` or `-`) used must not exceed `c`. Find all expressions that evaluate to `T`.


## Constraints

- `1 <= |s| <= 10`
- `0 <= c <= 9`
- `-10^9 <= T <= 10^9`
- No chunk may have leading zeros unless the chunk is exactly `"0"`
## Real-World Scenario

This is similar to the game **Countdown** or finding mathematical patterns in dates/phone numbers. Imagine you have a sequence of numbers and you want to reach a target value using limited operations, with a "wildcard" ability to flip the sign of one number.

## Problem Exploration

### 1. Structure of an Expression
An expression is a sum of terms.
`Term1 + Term2 - Term3 + ...`
Each term is a chunk of digits from the original string.
Example: `123` -> `1 + 23`, `12 + 3`, `1 - 2 - 3`.

### 2. The "One Flip" Rule
You can change the sign of exactly one chunk *before* it participates in the expression.
-   Normal: `1 + 23` -> Value `1 + 23 = 24`.
-   Flip `23`: `1 + (-23)` -> Value `1 - 23 = -22`.
-   Flip `1`: `(-1) + 23` -> Value `-1 + 23 = 22`.
Note that `1 - 23` is effectively `1 + (-23)`. The problem says "apply a unary negation to at most one operand chunk".
If we have `A - B`, and we flip `B`, it becomes `A - (-B) = A + B`.
If we have `A + B`, and we flip `B`, it becomes `A + (-B) = A - B`.
Basically, for one term, we can invert its sign contribution.

### 3. Constraints
-   Length `|s| <= 10`. This is very small, allowing full backtracking.
-   Max binary operators `c`. We must track this count.
-   Leading zeros are invalid (except "0").

## Approaches

### Approach 1: Backtracking
We define `backtrack(index, currentVal, opsCount, flipUsed, currentExpr)`.
-   **Base Case**:
    -   If `index == s.length`: Check if `currentVal == target`. Add to results.
-   **Recursive Step**:
    -   Iterate `j` from `index` to `s.length`.
    -   Extract substring `sub = s[index...j]`.
    -   Check for leading zeros.
    -   Parse `val = Long.parseLong(sub)`.
    -   **First Term**:
        -   Normal: `backtrack(j+1, val, 0, false, sub)`
        -   Flip: `backtrack(j+1, -val, 0, true, "-" + sub)` (Note: `-` here is unary, not binary op)
    -   **Subsequent Terms**:
        -   If `opsCount < maxOps`:
            -   **Add (+)**:
                -   Normal: `backtrack(j+1, curr + val, ops + 1, flip, expr + "+" + sub)`
                -   Flip (if !flipUsed): `backtrack(j+1, curr - val, ops + 1, true, expr + "+-" + sub)` (or `+(-val)`)
            -   **Subtract (-)**:
                -   Normal: `backtrack(j+1, curr - val, ops + 1, flip, expr + "-" + sub)`
                -   Flip (if !flipUsed): `backtrack(j+1, curr - (-val), ops + 1, true, expr + "--" + sub)`?
                -   *Clarification*: The problem says "write it with a leading `-` without adding an operator".
                -   Example: `1+-203`. This looks like `1 + (-203)`.
                -   So if we flip `val` to `-val`, and the operator is `+`, we write `+-val`. If operator is `-`, we write `--val`.
                -   Let's standardize: We are adding terms. The "binary operator" is effectively just the sign of the term relative to the previous sum, but the problem distinguishes between the operator and the unary sign.
                -   Let's stick to the example format. `1` (term) `+` (op) `-203` (flipped term).
                -   If we used `-` op and flipped term: `1 - -203`.

## 🧪 Test Case Walkthrough (Dry Run)
**Input:** `1203`, Target `-202`, MaxOps `2`

1.  Start `index=0`.
2.  Try `1`.
    -   First term `1`. `backtrack(1, 1, 0, F, "1")`
    -   Next chunk `203`.
        -   Try `+`: `1 + 203` = 204. Ops=1.
        -   Try `+` with flip: `1 + (-203)` = -202. Ops=1. Expr `1+-203`.
        -   **Match!** Add `1+-203`.
        -   Try `-`: `1 - 203` = -202. Ops=1. Expr `1-203`.
        -   **Match!** Add `1-203`.
        -   Try `-` with flip: `1 - (-203)` = 204. Ops=1. Expr `1--203`.

Does `1-203` count as using a flip? No.
Does `1+-203` count as using a flip? Yes.
The problem says "at most one operand chunk".
Both `1-203` (0 flips) and `1+-203` (1 flip) are valid if they reach target.
The example output lists `1+-203`.
`+` (ASCII 43) comes before `-` (ASCII 45).
So `1+-` comes before `1-` lexicographically.
The example output shows:
```
1+-203
```
`1-203` uses 1 binary operator (`-`).
`1+-203` uses 1 binary operator (`+`) and 1 unary flip (`-`).
"Return all valid expressions".
If `1-203` evaluates to -202, it is valid.
The problem says "You may also apply..." which means the flip is optional.
`1 - 203 = -202`. Correct.
`1-203` is `1` `-` `203`.
Both are mathematically -202.
The code generates all valid expressions. If `1-203` is valid, it will be output.
Subtraction exists independently of the flip operation.
The code correctly generates all valid forms according to the specification.

## Proof of Correctness

The backtracking solution exhaustively tries all partitions of the string into operands and all assignments of operators (`+`, `-`) and the unary flip.
-   **Completeness**: Every possible expression structure is visited.
-   **Correctness**: Constraints (max ops, one flip, leading zeros) are checked at each step.
-   **Order**: Sorting the final list ensures lexicographical order.

## Interview Extensions

1.  **Evaluate string expression**: Standard stack-based evaluation (Basic Calculator).
2.  **Add `*` operator**: Need to handle precedence. Pass `lastOperand` to backtracking to handle multiplication (undo addition, multiply, re-add).

### Common Mistakes

-   **Leading Zeros**: `05` is invalid. `0` is valid.
-   **Operator Count**: Unary minus does *not* count towards `c` (binary operators).
-   **Flip Logic**: Ensure flip is applied to the *value* (e.g., `val` becomes `-val`) and the *string* (prepend `-`).
