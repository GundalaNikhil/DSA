  - question: From word 'cat' (c=consonant, a=vowel, t=consonant), which words differ by 1 character?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - bat, hat, cut
      - cat, cot, cart
      - cut, bat
      - dog, run
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: "Changing one character in 'cat': position 0: bat, hat, fat, ... position 1: cot, cit, ... position 2: can, cap, car, ... (Single letter diff). 'cut' differs at position 1 (a→u). 'bat' differs at position 0 (c→b). Both work."

  - question: What does 'alternating vowel-consonant ladder' mean?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Words alternate between all vowels and all consonants
      - First letter type alternates between consecutive words in the path (vowel→consonant→vowel...)
      - Each word has alternating vowels and consonants
      - The path length alternates
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Ladder constraint: if word A starts with vowel, next word B must start with consonant (and vice versa). This ensures alternation of starting letter types along the path."

  - question: In building the word ladder graph, which two constraints must an edge satisfy?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Same length AND start-letter is same
      - Different by 1 character AND start-letter type alternates
      - Same number of vowels AND consonants are different
      - Length differs by 1 AND starts with same letter
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Edge from word A to B: (1) A and B differ by exactly 1 character (Hamming distance = 1), AND (2) First letter types must be opposite (vowel↔consonant alternation)."

  - question: Why use BFS to find shortest ladder, then DFS for path reconstruction?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - BFS is faster than DFS
      - BFS finds shortest path distances; DFS reconstructs all shortest paths using parent pointers
      - DFS alone is sufficient
      - BFS is simpler to implement
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: BFS levels guarantee shortest distance to each word. DFS reconstruction uses parent pointers to build all paths of that length. Combining both captures all shortest ladders.
