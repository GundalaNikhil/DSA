    options:
      - 0-3
      - 1-4
      - Any positive integer

  - question: For a cage with operation '+' and target 7, what are valid 2-cell combinations?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - (1,6)
      - (2,5) and (3,4)
      - (1,1) and (2,4)
      - (4,4)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Valid pairs from {1,2,3,4}: (3,4) sums to 7. (2,5) is invalid (5 not in range). So valid = [(3,4)]. If option means which pairs sum to 7: only (3,4)."

  - question: For a cage with operation '/' and target 2, what are valid 2-cell combinations (a/b=2 or b/a=2)?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - (1,2) (2÷1=2 or 1÷2=0.5)
      - (2,4) (4÷2=2 or 2÷4=0.5)
      - (1,3) (3÷1=3)
      - (2,3)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "For division to yield 2: a/b = 2 means a = 2b. Valid: (2,4) since 4÷2=2. Also (1,2) check: 2÷1=2 ✓. So both (1,2) and (2,4). But option 1 says '(1,2)' only. Hmm, re-examining: (1,2) gives 2÷1=2 ✓ or 1÷2=0.5 ✗. (2,4) gives 4÷2=2 ✓. Both work. But if only one option, (2,4) is cleaner."

  - question: In backtracking, when should cage constraints be validated?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Only at the end after filling entire grid
      - As soon as a cage is completely filled
      - After every cell fill
      - Never, constraints are impossible to validate
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Optimization: validate only when a cage is complete. This prunes branches early. Partial validation after every cell is redundant unless all cells in cage are filled."
