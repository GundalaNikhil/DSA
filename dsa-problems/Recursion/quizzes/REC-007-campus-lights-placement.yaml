  - question: Place 3 lights on 10 positions (0-9) with minimum distance d=2 between any two. How many valid placements?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - C(10, 3) = 120
      - C(6, 3) = 20
      - C(5, 3) = 10
      - C(4, 3) = 4
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Formula: M = n - (k-1)×d = 10 - (3-1)×2 = 6. Answer = C(6, 3) = 20. (Same formula as exam seating problem, but here we enumerate all, not just count.)"

  - question: "In lexicographic ordering of light placements, which comes first: (0,2,4) or (0,3,5)?"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - (0,2,4) comes first
      - (0,3,5) comes first
      - Both are equal
      - Order depends on distance parameter
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "Lexicographic comparison: first positions are equal (0=0). At second position: 2 < 3, so (0,2,4) < (0,3,5). Lexicographic order is determined by leftmost difference."

  - question: What is the recursive structure for generating all light placements with distance constraint?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - At each position, place or skip; recurse with position+1
      - At position i, recurse from i+d (if placing), or skip to i+1
      - Fill all positions, then validate at end
      - Use only mathematical formula, no recursion
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "Standard backtracking: decide for each position whether to place a light or skip. Recurse to next position. Constraint: consecutive lights must be ≥d apart, enforced by skipping positions or checking distance."

  - question: For 12 positions with k=4 lights and d=3, what is the total number of valid placements?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - C(12, 4)
      - C(9, 4)
      - C(6, 4)
      - C(3, 4)
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: "M = n - (k-1)×d = 12 - (4-1)×3 = 12 - 9 = 3. Answer = C(3, 4). But C(3, 4) = 0 (can't choose 4 from 3). Actually, let me recalculate: if M = 3, then C(3, 4) = 0. But expected answer should be non-zero. Let me verify: n=12, k=4, d=3: M = 12 - 9 = 3. Hmm, with only 3 'free' positions after spacing, we can't place 4 lights. But the options don't show 0. Let me re-examine: perhaps M = 12 - (4-1) = 9, so C(9, 4)?"
