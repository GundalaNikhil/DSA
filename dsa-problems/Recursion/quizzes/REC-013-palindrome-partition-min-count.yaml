  - question: For string 'nitin', how many palindromic substrings are needed for minimum partition?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - 1 (entire 'nitin' is palindrome)
      - "2"
      - "3"
      - "5"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "'nitin' itself is a palindrome (reads same forwards/backwards). Minimum partition = 1."

  - question: For string 'abcba', what is one possible minimum palindromic partition?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "[a,b,c,b,a]"
      - "[abcba]"
      - "[a,bcb,a]"
      - "[ab,c,ba]"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "'abcba' is a palindrome. Minimum partition = 1 piece: [abcba]."

  - question: What does 'lexicographically smallest' mean in palindrome partition context?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Shortest partition
      - When multiple partitions have same minimum count, return the one with smallest substrings lexicographically
      - Always starts with 'a'
      - Partitions are randomly ordered
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "If string 'abc' has two partitions of size 2: [a,bc] and [ab,c], lexicographically 'a' < 'ab', so [a,bc] is smaller (comparison is done position by position among partitions)."

  - question: For string 'aab', what is the minimum partition count?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - "1"
      - "2"
      - "3"
      - "4"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "'aab' is not a palindrome. Options: [a,ab] (not valid, 'ab' not palindrome), [a,a,b], [aa,b]. Both [a,a,b] and [aa,b] have 2 pieces (minimum)."
