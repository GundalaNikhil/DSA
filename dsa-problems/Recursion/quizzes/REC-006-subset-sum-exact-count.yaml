  - question: From array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], select exactly 2 elements summing to 5. How many ways?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - 1 way
      - 2 ways
      - 3 ways
      - 4 ways
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Pairs summing to 5: (1,4) and (2,3). Count = 2 ways."

  - question: If k=0 (select 0 elements), under what condition is there a valid subset?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Always 1 way (empty set)
      - Only if target = 0
      - Only if array is empty
      - Never possible
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Selecting 0 elements gives sum = 0. Valid only if target = 0. For any non-zero target with k=0, no solution.

  - question: What pruning condition prevents exploring branches where we can't select k elements?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - if (index >= n) return
      - if (n - index < k - count) return 0
      - if (sum > target) return
      - if (count > k) return
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: If remaining elements (n - index) is less than remaining needed (k - count), it's impossible to select k elements total. Early termination saves exponential branches.

  - question: For array [2, 2, 2, 2], select exactly 2 elements summing to 4. How many ways?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - 1 way
      - 4 ways
      - 6 ways
      - C(4, 2) = 6 ways
    correct_answer: 3
    explanation: All elements are identical. Selecting any 2 out of 4 gives sum = 4. Count = C(4, 2) = 6. Each pair is distinct by position, not value.
