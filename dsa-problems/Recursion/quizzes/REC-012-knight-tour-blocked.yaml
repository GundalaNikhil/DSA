  - question: From position (0, 0) on a chessboard, which positions can a knight reach in exactly 1 move?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - (1, 2) and (2, 1)
      - (1, 1) and (2, 2)
      - (2, 2) only
      - (1, 2), (2, 1), (-1, 2), (-2, 1)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "Knight moves: (±2, ±1) and (±1, ±2). From (0,0), valid moves staying on board: (1,2), (2,1). Negative coordinates are off-board."

  - question: What is the total number of possible knight moves from any position (considering all 8 directions)?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "4"
      - "6"
      - "8"
      - "16"
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: "Knight moves in 8 directions: (±2,±1) and (±1,±2). That's 2×2 + 2×2 = 8 moves."

  - question: In a 3×3 board with start (0,0) and all cells unblocked, what is the maximum number of cells the knight can visit?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - 9 (all cells)
      - 5 (limited by knight move range)
      - "3"
      - "1"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "3×3 board: positions (0,0) to (2,2). From (0,0), knight can reach (1,2) and (2,1). From (1,2), it can reach (0,0), (2,0), (3,1), etc. (many off-board). The knight's reach is limited; a 3×3 board is too small for a full tour."

  - question: For a 5×5 board with some blocked cells, what is the worst-case time complexity of finding a Hamiltonian path?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(n^2)
      - O(n^3)
      - O(8^(n^2))
      - O(n!)
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: "Hamiltonian path is NP-Complete. Worst case: try all paths. With n=25 cells, branching up to 8 per cell, time = O(8^25) in worst case. Warnsdorff heuristic reduces this significantly in practice."
