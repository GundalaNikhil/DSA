  - question: For input string 'aba', how many valid permutations have no adjacent identical characters?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "1"
      - "2"
      - "3"
      - "0"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "String 'aba' has one 'b' and two 'a's. Unique perms: aba, baa, aab. Valid (no adjacent identical): aba. Invalid: baa (aa adjacent), aab (aa adjacent). So 1 valid permutation."

  - question: What is the purpose of sorting the input string before permutation generation?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - To make the algorithm faster
      - To ensure lexicographic ordering of output and enable duplicate pruning
      - To remove all duplicate characters
      - To detect if a solution exists
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Sorting groups duplicate characters together, enabling the pruning condition: skip char[i] if char[i] == char[i-1] && !used[i-1]. Also, iterating sorted chars naturally produces lexicographic output."

  - question: "The duplicate pruning condition is: 'if (chars[i] == chars[i-1] && !used[i-1]) continue'. Why is the '!used[i-1]' part essential?"
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - To skip only the first duplicate
      - "To enforce using duplicates in order: use first occurrence before second"
      - To make backtracking faster
      - To validate lexicographic order
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "This ensures we use duplicates in left-to-right order: use chars[i-1] before chars[i]. If the previous identical char (!used[i-1]), we can't use the current one yet. This prevents generating the same permutation multiple times from different orderings."

  - question: For string 'aabb', how many valid permutations exist with no adjacent identical characters?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - "0"
      - "2"
      - "4"
      - "6"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Valid perms: 'abab', 'baba'. All others have adjacent identical chars: 'aabb' (aa), 'abba' (bb), 'baab' (aa), 'bbaa' (bb). So exactly 2 valid permutations."
