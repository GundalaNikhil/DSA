  - question: For courses [0, 1, 2] with prerequisite 1→0 (1 before 0), how many valid orderings exist?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - 1 (only 1,2,0)
      - 2 (1,2,0 or 2,1,0)
      - 3 (no constraints)
      - 0 (impossible)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Course 0 depends on 1, so 1 must come first. Course 2 has no dependency. Valid: 1,2,0 and 2,1,0. Both respect 1→0 constraint. Total = 2."

  - question: If a cycle exists (e.g., 0→1→0), how many valid orderings are possible?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - 0 (cycle makes it impossible)
      - 1 (can still order)
      - Infinite (cycle repeats)
      - 2 (forward and backward)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "A cycle means there's no valid topological ordering. Course 0 requires 1, which requires 0: impossible. Return 'NONE'."

  - question: In the backtracking topological sort, after choosing a course and decrementing its neighbors' indegrees, what must happen during backtracking?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Leave indegrees decremented
      - Restore indegrees by incrementing neighbors back
      - Recalculate all indegrees
      - Reset the visited array only
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Backtracking requires state restoration. After exploring a branch where we picked course X and decremented neighbor indegrees, we must undo this by incrementing them back.

  - question: For 4 courses [0, 1, 2, 3] with no prerequisites, how many valid orderings exist?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - "1"
      - "4"
      - 24 (4!)
      - 16 (2^4)
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: With no dependencies, all orderings are valid. This is 4! = 24 permutations of courses.
