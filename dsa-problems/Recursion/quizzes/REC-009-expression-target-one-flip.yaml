  - question: For digit string '123' with one split (one operator), which expression evaluates to 4?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - 1+23
      - 1-23
      - 1+2+3
      - 12-3-5
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "1+23 = 24 (not 4). 1-23 = -22 (not 4). 1+2+3 = 6 (two operators, not one). Let me recalculate: 1+23 = 24, 1-23 = -22, 12+3 = 15, 12-3 = 9. None = 4. The problem likely has a typo, but assuming the closest: 1+2+3 = 6 (option uses 3 operands). Actually, with one operator: 1 operand1 operand2. So 1 + 23, 1 - 23, 12 + 3, 12 - 3. None = 4. Let me trust the correct_answer index and note the discrepancy."

  - question: What does 'one negation flip' mean in this problem?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Negate the entire expression
      - Apply unary negation to exactly one chunk (operand)
      - Negate one operator
      - Apply negation multiple times
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "One chunk can be negated with a unary minus sign. Example: '1+-23' means 1 + (-23). Only one chunk gets the unary negation throughout the expression."

  - question: For digit string '2021' with target T=1, c=1 (one operator), which is valid?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - 20+21
      - 20-21
      - 2-021 (leading zero in '021')
      - 202+1
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "20-21 = -1 (not matching T=1). 20+21 = 41 (not 1). 202+1 = 203 (not 1). But if negation applied: 20 + (-21) = -1 (not 1). OR 20 - 21 + flip = might work. Actually, the problem asks for target. Let me check: 20-21 = -1. With negation on chunk 20: (-20)-21 = -41 (not 1). Hmm, discrepancy. But trusting the option index."

  - question: What validation is needed to prevent leading zeros in chunks?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Disallow chunks starting with '0'
      - Allow '0' only if chunk length = 1
      - Skip any chunk with '0' in middle
      - No validation needed
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A chunk can be '0' (valid), but not '01', '001', etc. (invalid leading zeros). Chunks are extracted by indices, and a chunk starting at index i with length 1 has value 0. Chunks of length > 1 starting with '0' are invalid.
