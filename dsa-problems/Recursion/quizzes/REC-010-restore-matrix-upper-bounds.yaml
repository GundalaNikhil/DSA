  - question: For a 2×2 matrix with bounds [[1,1],[1,1]], row sums [2,2], column sums [2,2], what is matrix[0][0]?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "0"
      - "1"
      - "2"
      - Impossible (no solution)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Row 0 sum = 2, all bounds = 1. So matrix[0][0] + matrix[0][1] = 2, each ≤ 1, so each = 1. Similarly, matrix[1][0] = matrix[1][1] = 1. This satisfies all constraints.

  - question: What does it mean if at the last column, the remaining row sum doesn't match the sum of bounds?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - We can proceed normally
      - The solution is invalid; backtrack immediately
      - We need more columns
      - Change the bound value
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "At the last column, the cell value is forced: it must equal the remaining row sum. If this forced value exceeds the bound, no solution exists in that branch."

  - question: For a 3×3 matrix, which constraint is checked first when filling cell (i,j)?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - If i == last row, check column sum
      - If j == last column, force cell value = remaining row sum
      - Always try all values up to bound
      - If column sum < 0, backtrack
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Lookahead optimization: if j is the last column, the cell value is completely determined: value = row_remaining[i]. This forces early termination or constraint checking."

  - question: For feasibility check, if remaining_row_sum = 10, number of remaining cells in row = 2, and max bound per cell = 4, is it feasible?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Yes, always feasible
      - No, remaining sum (10) > max possible (2×4=8)
      - Maybe, depends on column constraints
      - Yes, but requires backtracking
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Max possible sum for remaining cells = 2 × 4 = 8. But we need 10. Impossible. Early termination and backtrack.
