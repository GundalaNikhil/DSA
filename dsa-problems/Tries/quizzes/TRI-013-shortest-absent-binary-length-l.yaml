questions:
  - question: We want the lexicographically smallest missing binary string of length L. In DFS, which branch do we try first?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "'0' (Zero)"
      - "'1' (One)"
      - Random
      - Neither
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "'0' is lexicographically smaller than '1'."

  - question: If we find that the '0' branch is missing in the Trie (i.e., no existing string starts with this prefix), what is the optimal missing string?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Current prefix + '0' + all remaining characters as '0'
      - Current prefix + '0' + all remaining characters as '1'
      - Current prefix only
      - Current prefix + '1'...
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Since no string exists there, the lexicographically first option is valid, so we pad with smallest char '0'.

  - question: "If we explore the entire Trie and find no missing string (i.e., all 2^L strings are present), we return:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Empty string or special indicator
      - A string of length L+1
      - Error
      - The last string found
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Though rare for large L, if the set is complete, no absent string exists.

  - question: What is the Time Complexity for searching the shortest absent string?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(2^L) in worst case (full tree), but practically O(min(N*L, 2^L))
      - O(N^2)
      - O(1)
      - O(log N)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We stop as soon as we find a missing branch.
