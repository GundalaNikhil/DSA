questions:
  - question: We need to find the k-th lexicographically smallest string of length <= L that is NOT in the given set. How many possible strings of length <= L using 'a'-'z' exist?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Sum of 26^i for i=1 to L
      - 26^L
      - L^26
      - 26 * L
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "Geometric series sum: 26 + 26^2 + ... + 26^L."

  - question: How do we efficiently skip entire subtrees in the Trie?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - We count how many missing strings exist in the subtree 'virtually'
      - We traverse every node
      - We use random sampling
      - We sort the input
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: If a subtree rooted at 'a' has 100 missing strings and we need the 200th, we can skip 'a' entirely and subtract 100 from K.

  - question: If a node in the traversal does not exist in the inserted Trie, what does it mean for the missing strings under it?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - All possible strings starting with this prefix are missing
      - None are missing
      - Only 1 is missing
      - It's an error
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The absence of a node means no string in the input set has that prefix.

  - question: What is the critical constraint on L usually?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Small (e.g., <= 6 or 10)
      - Large (e.g., 1000)
      - Negative
      - Variable
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Since 26^L grows explosively, L must be small for combinatorial counting to fit in 64-bit integers.
