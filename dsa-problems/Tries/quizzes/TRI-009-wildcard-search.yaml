questions:
  - question: "In the wildcard search, '?' matches exactly one character, while '*' matches:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Zero or more characters sequence
      - Exactly one character
      - Zero characters only
      - One or more characters
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "Standard globbing rules: * is flexible length."

  - question: "When we encounter a '*' in the pattern during DFS, we branch into two possibilities:"
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Match 0 characters (stay at current node, advance pattern) OR Match 1+ characters (advance node, keep pattern)
      - Match 0 characters OR Match 1 character only
      - Match all remaining characters
      - Skip the * entirely
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: To match 1+, we consume a character from the Trie but keep the * in the pattern to allow it to match more.

  - question: What is the worst-case time complexity of matching a pattern with many '*' against a deep Trie?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Exponential in the number of stars
      - Linear O(N)
      - Logarithmic
      - O(1)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Multiple stars can cause significant backtracking, visiting many paths repeatedly.

  - question: If the pattern ends with a normal character, what condition must be met at the Trie node?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - The node must be marked isEnd (end of word)
      - The node must have children
      - The node must be the root
      - The node count must be > 1
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We must ensure the matched path corresponds to a complete word valid in the dictionary.
