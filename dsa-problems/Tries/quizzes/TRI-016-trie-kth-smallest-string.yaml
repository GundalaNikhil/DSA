slug: trie-kth-smallest-string
questions:
  - question: To find the k-th lexicographically smallest string, we perform what kind of traversal on the Trie?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Pre-order DFS (visiting children 'a' through 'z' in order)
      - Post-order DFS
      - BFS
      - Random
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Lexicographical order matches the natural structure of the Trie's alphabet-ordered children.

  - question: "We can optimize the search by storing 'count' metadata at each node. 'count' represents:"
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - The total number of valid words stored in the subtree rooted at this node
      - The frequency of the prefix
      - The length of the word
      - The character value
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: This allows us to skip entire subtrees if K > count, subtracting count from K.

  - question: If we skip a subtree with count C because K > C, what happens to K?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - K becomes K - C
      - K stays the same
      - K becomes C
      - K becomes K + C
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We have effectively 'passed' C smaller words, so we need the (K-C)-th word in the subsequent search space.

  - question: If the current node is marked isEnd (it is a word itself), it counts as one word. Does it come before or after its children?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Before (it effectively ends here)
      - After
      - It doesn't matter
      - Parallel
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: In lexicographical order, a prefix (shorter word like 'app') comes before extensions ('apple').
