questions:
  - question: "We want to replace words with a root from the dictionary. The selection criteria is:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Lowest rarity score, then shortest length
      - Highest rarity score
      - Longest matching root
      - First match found
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Tie-breaking prefers the shortest root if rarities are equal.

  - question: In the Trie, what information should be stored at each node to facilitate efficient replacement?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - The 'best' root found so far in the path to this node
      - All possible roots
      - Just the character
      - The word count
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Storing the best (min rarity) root allows us to update our candidate as we traverse.

  - question: If the traversal of a word in the sentence falls off the Trie (no child), what do we do?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Use the best root found so far, or the original word if none found
      - Delete the word
      - Replace with empty string
      - Throw an error
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We stop searching and commit to the best match we saw. If we saw nothing, we keep the original.

  - question: "Compared to checking every dictionary word for every sentence word (Naive O(N*M*L)), the Trie approach is:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Linear O(N*L + M*K)
      - Quadratic
      - Exponential
      - Logarithmic
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We process each character of the sentence and dictionary exactly once (roughly).
