questions:
  - question: We insert {'car', 'cat', 'cart'} into a Trie. How many total nodes are created (excluding root)?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - c-a-r (3) + t (1) + t (1) = 5
      - 3 + 3 + 4 = 10
      - "3"
      - "6"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "Shared: 'ca'. 'r'(car), 't'(cat) branch off 'a'. 'cart' extends 'car' with 't'. Nodes: c,a,r,t,t. Sum = 5."

  - question: "The size of the Trie (number of nodes) represents:"
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - The minimum number of characters needed to store the dictionary exploiting shared prefixes
      - The number of words
      - The total length of all words
      - The number of distinct characters in the alphabet
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: It essentially compresses common prefixes into single paths.

  - question: Why is this 'naive' approach of building the Trie and counting nodes actually optimal?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - We must process every character to know if it contributes a new node or shares an existing path
      - It isn't optimal, O(N) exists
      - Sorting helps
      - Hashing is faster
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The prefix sharing property requires knowledge of all words' prefixes, necessitating O(Total Characters) work.

  - question: What is the worst-case space complexity for N words of length L?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(N * L) (No shared prefixes)
      - O(L)
      - O(N)
      - O(1)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: If all words are disjoint (e.g., 'a', 'b', 'c'...), we create a chain for each, totaling N*L nodes.
