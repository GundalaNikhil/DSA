questions:
  - question: "We want to find min(A XOR B) such that XOR <= Limit. In the Binary Trie, we process bits from:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - MSB (Most Significant Bit) to LSB
      - LSB to MSB
      - Random order
      - Middle outwards
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Higher bits contribute more to the value. We effectively partition the search space by MSB.

  - question: To minimize XOR with a target number X, if the current bit of X is 0, we prefer to go to which child branch in the Trie?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - 0 branch
      - 1 branch
      - Either
      - Root
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: 0 XOR 0 = 0. Going to the '1' branch would cause the XOR result to have a 1 at this position, increasing the value.

  - question: If the preferred branch does not exist, we are forced to go to the other branch. What does this imply?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - We accumulate a '1' at the current bit position in the XOR sum
      - The search fails
      - We found the answer
      - We must backtrack
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: If X has bit 0 and only '1' branch exists, result bit is 0 XOR 1 = 1.

  - question: Why is the time complexity O(N * 32) considered efficient?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - It is effectively linear O(N) since 32 is a small constant
      - It's faster than O(1)
      - Memory is low
      - It works for floats
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Compared to O(N^2) brute force, O(N) is suitable for N=10^5.
