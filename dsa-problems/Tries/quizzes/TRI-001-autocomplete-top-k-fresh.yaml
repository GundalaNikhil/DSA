  - question: "The score of a word is calculated as: Score = Frequency * exp(-(CurrentTime - LastUsed) / D). If a word has frequency 10, was last used at time 8, current time is 10, and D=2, what is its score?"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - 10 * e^(-1) ≈ 3.68
      - 10 * e^(-2) ≈ 1.35
      - 10 * e^(1) ≈ 27.18
      - "10"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Age = 10 - 8 = 2. Exponent = -2 / 2 = -1. Score = 10 * 0.3678...

  - question: Why is exponential decay used instead of a simple sliding window?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - It provides a smooth reduction in weight over time without a hard cutoff
      - It is faster to calculate
      - It requires less memory
      - It increases the score of old items
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Sliding windows drop items abruptly. Exponential decay ensures old popular items fade out gradually.

  - question: When two words have the exact same score (tie), how should they be ordered?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Lexicographically ascending (A-Z)
      - Lexicographically descending (Z-A)
      - Randomly
      - By length
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Standard tie-breaking rule to ensure deterministic output.

  - question: "To efficiently find all words with a given prefix, we traverse the Trie to the prefix node and then:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Perform DFS/BFS to collect all descendants
      - Return the prefix node itself
      - Check the parent
      - Start from root again
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The subtree rooted at the prefix node contains all valid completions.
