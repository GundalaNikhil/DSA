  - question: "This problem asks for the longest string P such that:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - P is a prefix of every word (possibly after deleting one character from the word)
      - P is a subsequence of every word
      - P is a substring of every word
      - P is a palindrome
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We allow one deletion per word to match the prefix.

  - question: To solve this using a Trie, what do we insert for each word S?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - S and all variants of S formed by removing exactly one character
      - Only S
      - Only the deletion variants
      - Reversed S
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: This ensures that if a prefix forms via deletion, it exists in the Trie.

  - question: How do we verify if a prefix is valid for ALL words?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Store a set of word IDs at each node; size of set must equal total words
      - Check if the node has children
      - Check if the node is marked isEnd
      - Count the frequency of visits
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: If node.wordIds.size() == N, then every word can reach this prefix (possibly via a variant).

  - question: What is a critical edge case when generating deletion variants?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Single character words becoming empty strings
      - Words with numbers
      - Words longer than 100
      - Duplicate words
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Deleting the only character results in an empty string, which is a valid prefix (length 0).
