questions:
  - question: "Given words ['zebra', 'dog', 'duck', 'dove'], finding the minimum unique prefix for 'dove' results in:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - dov
      - do
      - d
      - dove
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "'d' matches 'dog', 'duck'. 'do' matches 'dog'. 'dov' is unique (distinguishes from 'dog')."

  - question: In the Trie solution, what information do we store at each node to efficiently find the unique prefix?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - The count of words passing through this node (frequency)
      - The list of all words
      - The character only
      - IsEnd flag only
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: If a node has count 1, it means only one word in the entire dictionary uses this path, so it's unique.

  - question: "When finding the unique prefix for a word, we traverse the Trie until:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - We find a node with count == 1, or reach the end of the word
      - We reach a leaf node
      - We find a node with count > 1
      - We find a branching point
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Count 1 implies uniqueness. If we reach the end and count is still > 1, the word itself is a prefix of another.

  - question: What is the Time Complexity to find unique prefixes for all N words with average length L?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(N * L)
      - O(N^2)
      - O(N * L^2)
      - O(N log N)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We build the Trie in O(N*L) and query each word in O(L). Total O(N*L).
