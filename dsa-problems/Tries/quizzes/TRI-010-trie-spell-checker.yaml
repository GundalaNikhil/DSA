  - question: "We are looking for words with Edit Distance <= 1. This includes:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Exact match, 1 insertion, 1 deletion, 1 substitution
      - Exact match only
      - Any word with same length
      - Any word starting with same letter

    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Advance the query index + 1, keeping the Trie node same, and increment edits
      - Advance Trie node, keep query index
      - Advance both
      - Do nothing
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We skip a character in the query assuming it was an extra insertion, effectively deleting it.

  - question: Why use a Trie instead of calculating Levenshtein distance against every dictionary word?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Trie allows pruning entire branches that cannot match within the edit limit
      - Trie is easier to implement
      - Levenshtein distance is O(N^3)
      - Dictionary words are sorted
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Checking every word is O(DictionarySize * Length). Trie is much faster on average.
