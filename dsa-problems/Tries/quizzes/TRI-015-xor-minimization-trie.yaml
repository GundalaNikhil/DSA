questions:
  - question: We want to minimize P XOR X. If the k-th bit of X is 1, what bit do we prefer in P?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - 1 (so 1 XOR 1 = 0)
      - 0 (so 0 XOR 1 = 1)
      - Doesn't matter
      - Both
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We want the result bit to be 0 to minimize the value.

  - question: "To solve the subarray XOR problem (min XOR of subarray XORs with target X), we use the property:"
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - XOR(A[i...j]) = PrefixXOR[j] ^ PrefixXOR[i]
      - XOR(A[i...j]) = A[i] ^ ... ^ A[j]
      - Subarray sum
      - Segment Tree
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We transform the problem to finding two numbers in the prefix array whose XOR is minimal (relative to target).

  - question: "If the preferred bit branch does not exist in the Trie, we:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Take the forced path (which results in a '1' at that bit position in the result)
      - Stop traversal
      - Return error
      - Backtrack
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We have no choice but to accept a higher value for this bit.

  - question: "The height of the Binary Trie for 32-bit integers is fixed at:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - 30-32 levels
      - N levels
      - Log N levels
      - 100 levels
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: It depends on the bit-width of the numbers, typically 30 for values up to 10^9.
