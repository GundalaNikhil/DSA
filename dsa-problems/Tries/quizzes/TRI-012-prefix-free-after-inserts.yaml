  - question: "A set of strings is 'Prefix-Free' if:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - No string is a prefix of another string in the set
      - All strings have different prefixes
      - No string starts with a vowel
      - All strings are unique
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "Example: {911, 91123} is NOT prefix-free because 911 is a prefix of 91123."

  - question: "When inserting a new number 'S' into the Trie, two conditions cause a failure:"
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - We pass through an existing 'isEnd' node (Existing is prefix of New) OR We end at a node that already has children (New is prefix of Existing)
      - We find the exact same number
      - The Trie is full
      - We pass through the root
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "Case 1: '911' exists, inserting '91125'. Case 2: '91125' exists, inserting '911'."

  - question: Why is the Trie optimal here compared to comparing with all existing strings?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Insertion is O(L) vs O(N*L) comparison
      - Trie uses less memory
      - Comparison is impossible
      - It sorts the strings
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We only traverse the length of the new string, checking conflicts along the path.
