questions:
  - question: "We want to find the longest word that has at least K valid prefixes in the dictionary. 'Valid prefix' means:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - A prefix that is itself a valid word in the dictionary (excluding the word itself)
      - Any prefix string
      - A prefix of length >= K
      - A prefix starting with 'a'
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We count how many proper prefixes are marked as isEnd=true.

  - question: When picking the best word, if two words have lengths 5 and 5, which one do we choose?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - The lexicographically smaller one
      - The lexicographically larger one
      - The one with more prefixes
      - The first one found
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Standard problem constraint to ensure deterministic output.

  - question: "To efficiently count valid prefixes for a word using a Trie, we:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Traverse the path for the word and count nodes marked isEnd (excluding the final node)
      - Count all nodes
      - Count leaf nodes
      - Traverse all words
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Scanning the path gives O(L) complexity per word.

  - question: If no word satisfies the condition (has >= K prefixes), what should be returned?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Empty string
      - "Null"
      - Error
      - The shortest word
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: It implies no candidate met the threshold.
