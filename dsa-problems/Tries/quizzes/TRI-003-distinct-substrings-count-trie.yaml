questions:
  - question: For the string 'aba', what are the distinct substrings?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "a, b, ab, ba, aba (Count: 5)"
      - a, b, ab, ba, aa, bb
      - aba, ba, a
      - "3"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "Substrings: a, ab, aba, b, ba, a (duplicate). Unique: a, b, ab, ba, aba."

  - question: "Using a Suffix Trie, the number of distinct substrings corresponds to:"
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Total number of nodes in the Trie (excluding root)
      - Number of leaf nodes
      - Height of the Trie
      - Number of edges
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Every node represents a unique path from the root, i.e., a unique substring.

  - question: What is the worst-case space complexity of a Suffix Trie for string length N?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(N^2)
      - O(N)
      - O(2^N)
      - O(log N)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: In worst case (e.g., 'abcdef'), every suffix creates a distinct branch, total nodes ~ N(N+1)/2.

  - question: To optimize space for very large strings (e.g., N=10^5), which structure is preferred over a standard Suffix Trie?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Suffix Array + LCP Array
      - Binary Search Tree
      - Hash Set
      - Heap
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Suffix Automaton or Suffix Array takes O(N) space, avoiding the O(N^2) explosion.
