questions:
  - question: "A substring is 'repeated' if it appears:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - At least twice in the string
      - Exactly twice
      - As a palindrome
      - At the start and end
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We look for the longest string with frequency >= 2.

  - question: "In the Suffix Trie, a node represents a repeated substring if:"
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - The count of suffixes passing through it is >= 2
      - It is a leaf node
      - It is the root
      - It has 2 children
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Each suffix insertion increments counts along its path. Count X means X suffixes share this prefix.

  - question: "The 'depth' of a node in the Suffix Trie corresponds to:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - The length of the substring represented by the path to this node
      - The number of repeated times
      - The index in the string
      - The character value
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Root is depth 0. Each edge adds 1 character to length.

  - question: Building a naive Suffix Trie takes O(N^2). Is this efficient for N=10^5?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - No, usually Time Limit Exceeded
      - Yes, it's fine
      - It depends on the alphabet
      - Only in Java
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: O(N^2) is too slow for 10^5. Suffix Array (O(N log N)) or Suffix Tree (O(N)) is needed for large inputs.
