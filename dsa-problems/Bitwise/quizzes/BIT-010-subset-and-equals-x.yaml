  - question:
      "What is the AND result when all elements in a subset are the same value V?

      "
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "0"
      - V
      - 2V
      - Undefined
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "V AND V AND ... AND V = V. The AND of identical values is the value itself, \nsince every bit position remains the same across all ANDs.\n"

  - question: "For X = 0, which element must be present in any valid subset?

      "
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - At least one 0
      - All elements must be 0
      - At least one power of 2
      - No specific requirement
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "To achieve AND = 0, at least one element must be 0, because 0 AND anything = 0. \nIf no element is 0, the AND can never be 0.\n"

  - question: "Which properties of AND operation help in this problem?

      "
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - "AND is commutative: a & b = b & a"
      - "AND is associative: (a & b) & c = a & (b & c)"
      - "AND is monotone decreasing: adding elements decreases or maintains value"
      - AND has identity element 0
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "AND is commutative and associative (correct), allowing any order of operations. \nIt's monotone decreasing (correct), enabling pruning. However, -1 (all bits set), \nnot 0, is the identity: a & -1 = a.\n"

  - question: "For array [6, 3, 2] and X = 2, how many valid subsets exist?

      "
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - "2"
      - "3"
      - "5"
      - "7"
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: "Valid subsets: {2} (2), {6,3} (2), {6,2} (2), {3,2} (2), {6,3,2} (2) = 5 subsets. \nSingle elements {6} (6) and {3} (3) don't match X=2.\n"
