- question: For array [3, 6, 2, 8] at index 0, what is 0 ⊕ 3?
  difficulty: easy
  points: 10
  options:
  - '0'
  - '3'
  - '6'
  - '9'
  correct_answer: 1
  explanation: 0 ⊕ 3 = 000 ⊕ 011 = 011 = 3. XORing with 0 leaves the value unchanged.

- question: 'How many set bits are in the binary representation of 7 (binary: 111)?'
  difficulty: easy
  points: 10
  options:
  - '1'
  - '2'
  - '3'
  - '7'
  correct_answer: 2
  explanation: 7 in binary is 111, which has three 1s, so 3 set bits.

- question: For array [0, 1, 2, 3], what is the total set bit count?
  difficulty: easy
  points: 10
  options:
  - '0'
  - '4'
  - '6'
  - '10'
  correct_answer: 0
  explanation: 'For each i: i⊕arr[i] = i⊕i = 0. All XORs are 0, so total set bits = 0.'
  type: single_choice
  id: edq_2
- question: Which functions correctly count set bits? (Select all that apply)
  difficulty: medium
  points: 15
  options:
  - Integer.bitCount() in Java
  - bin(n).count('1') in Python
  - __builtin_popcount() in C++
  - n.toString(2).length in JavaScript
  correct_answer: 0
  explanation: Options 0-2 correctly count set bits (1s). Option 3 gives the total length of binary representation, not the count of 1s.
