    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Once
      - Twice
      - Three times
      - Four times
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: According to the problem, every number appears exactly three times except two distinct numbers that appear once each.

  - question: What is the purpose of the mask M in this problem?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - To count the total number of set bits
      - To identify a bit position where the two unique numbers differ
      - To filter out numbers divisible by M
      - To limit the maximum value
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The mask M is guaranteed to have at least one bit set where the two unique numbers differ. This helps us separate them after XOR operations.

  - question: For the array [5,5,5,9,9,9,3,6] with M=2, what are the two unique numbers?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - 5 and 9
      - 3 and 6
      - 2 and 3
      - 6 and 9
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: In the array, 5 appears 3 times, 9 appears 3 times, but 3 and 6 each appear only once. These are the two unique numbers.

  - question: Which of the following are guaranteed by the problem constraints? (Select all that apply)
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - The two unique numbers are distinct
      - The mask M has at least one bit set where the unique numbers differ
      - All numbers in the array are positive
      - The array length is always even
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The problem guarantees that the two unique numbers are distinct (A) and that M identifies a differing bit (B). Numbers can be zero or negative, and array length depends on the number of triples plus two uniques.
