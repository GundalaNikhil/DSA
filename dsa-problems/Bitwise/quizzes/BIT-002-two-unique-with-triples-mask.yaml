    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "To count the total number of set bits"
        correct: false

    type: multiple_choice
    question: "Which of the following are guaranteed by the problem constraints? (Select all that apply)"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "The two unique numbers are distinct"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "The mask M has at least one bit set where the unique numbers differ"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "All numbers in the array are positive"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "The array length is always even"
        correct: false
    explanation: "The problem guarantees that the two unique numbers are distinct (A) and that M identifies a differing bit (B). Numbers can be zero or negative, and array length depends on the number of triples plus two uniques."

    category: "problem"
    type: single_choice
    question: "What would happen if we tried to solve this with simple XOR like the 'single unique' problem?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "We'd get the correct answer"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "We'd get the XOR of the two unique numbers, not the individual numbers"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "We'd get 0"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "We'd get an error"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Simple XOR won't work directly because numbers appear 3 times (not 2). Even after handling triples, we'd get the XOR of both unique numbers combined, not the individual values. We need additional logic to separate them."

    question: "What is the key technique for handling numbers that appear three times?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Use a hash map to count occurrences"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "Count set bits at each position modulo 3"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "Sort the array first"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Use two pointers"
        correct: false
    explanation: "The elegant solution counts set bits at each bit position across all numbers, then takes modulo 3. Bits from numbers appearing 3 times cancel out (3 mod 3 = 0), leaving only bits from the two unique numbers."

    question: "After counting bits mod 3, what do we obtain?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "One of the two unique numbers"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"

        text: "The sum of the two unique numbers"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Zero"
        correct: false
    explanation: "After counting bits mod 3, we get the XOR of the two unique numbers. This is because numbers appearing 3 times contribute 0 mod 3 to each bit position."

    question: "How do we use the mask M to separate the two unique numbers?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "AND each number with M"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"

      - option_id: "C"
        text: "XOR each number with M"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Divide each number by M"
        correct: false
    explanation: "We find a bit position where M has a 1 AND the XOR result has a 1 (meaning the unique numbers differ there). Then we partition the array based on whether numbers have that bit set, processing each partition separately with mod-3 counting."

      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Dynamic programming"
        correct: false

        text: "O(32n)"
        correct: false

  - quiz_id: "EDQ-BIT-002-Q007"
    category: "editorial"
    type: scenario
    question: "You're processing a stream of sensor readings where most sensors report 3 times but two faulty sensors report only once. You have 1 million readings and need to identify the faulty sensors quickly. Which approach is best?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Sort and scan for singles"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "Use hash map to count all occurrences"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "Use bit counting mod 3 with mask-based separation"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Compare every pair of readings"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Sorting takes O(n log n), hash map takes O(n) time and O(n) space. Bit counting mod 3 achieves O(n) time with O(1) space, making it optimal for large datasets. The mask helps separate the two unique values efficiently."

    type: single_choice
    question: "Why is the mask M necessary in this problem?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "It's not necessary, just a hint"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "Without it, we can't efficiently separate the two unique numbers"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "It reduces the time complexity"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "It's only needed for validation"
        correct: false
    explanation: "The mask M is crucial because after mod-3 bit counting, we get the XOR of both unique numbers. We need to know at least one bit position where they differ to partition and solve separately. While we could find such a bit from the XOR result alone, M guarantees we can find one efficiently."
