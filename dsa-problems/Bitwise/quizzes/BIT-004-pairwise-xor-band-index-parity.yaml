questions:
  - question: Given array [5, 3, 8, 4] with k=2, which pairs satisfy BOTH the band constraint (|i-j| ≤ k) AND the parity constraint (same parity indices)?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - (0,1), (1,2), (2,3)
      - (0,2), (1,3)
      - (0,2), (0,3), (1,3)
      - (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,3)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Only (0,2) satisfies: |0-2|=2≤2 and both even. And (1,3) satisfies: |1-3|=2≤2 and both odd. Pair (0,1) has different parity (even vs odd). Pair (0,3) has distance 3>2."

  - question: What is the result when k=0 for any array?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - XOR of all elements
      - "0"
      - First element
      - Depends on array values
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: When k=0, no valid pairs exist since we need |i-j|≤0 with i<j, which is impossible. Therefore, the result is 0 (no XOR operations performed).

  - question: Which of the following optimizations are valid for this problem? (Select all that apply)
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Process even and odd indices separately
      - Sort the array to reduce comparisons
      - Use a hash map to store XOR values
      - Skip pairs where elements are equal
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Processing even and odd indices separately is valid since they form independent groups. Sorting would change indices, violating the position-based constraints. Hash maps don't help since we need positional information. Skipping equal elements doesn't save significant work and can complicate logic.

  - question: For array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] with k=1, how many valid pairs exist?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - "0"
      - "2"
      - "4"
      - "8"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "With k=1, we can only pair indices with distance ≤1. For same parity: (0,2)? No, distance=2. (1,3)? No, distance=2. (2,4)? No, distance=2. No valid pairs exist because same-parity indices are always 2 apart."
