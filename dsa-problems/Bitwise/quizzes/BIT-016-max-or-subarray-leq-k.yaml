    question: What property of the bitwise OR allows for a sliding window approach?
    options: &id001
      - It is commutative
      - It is monotonic (ORing more elements never decreases the value)
      - It is distributive
      - It cancels out duplicates
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: As the window expands, the OR value only increases or stays the same. If it exceeds K, we shrink the window.

    question: What property of the bitwise OR allows for a sliding window approach?
    options: *id001
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: As the window expands, the OR value only increases or stays the same. If it exceeds K, we shrink the window.

    question: When shrinking a sliding window, how do you correctly 'remove' a number's effect from the bitwise OR sum?
    options:
      - Use XOR
      - Maintain a bit-count array and recalculate the OR from bit positions with count > 0
      - Subtract the number
      - Use the AND inverse
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Since OR is not reversible like XOR, we track the total count of '1' bits at each position. A bit is 1 in the window OR if its count is > 0.

    question: What is the time complexity of the bit-count sliding window approach for N elements and 32-bit integers?
    options:
      - O(N)
      - O(N * 32)
      - O(N^2)
      - O(N log N)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Each element is added and removed once. Each addition/removal updates 32 bit positions.
