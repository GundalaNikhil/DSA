- question: What is the XOR of 5 (101) and 3 (011)?
  difficulty: easy
  points: 10
  options:
  - 4 (100)
  - 6 (110)
  - 2 (010)
  - 8 (1000)
  correct_answer: 1
  explanation: 5 ⊕ 3 = 101 ⊕ 011 = 110 = 6. XOR gives 1 where bits differ (positions 1 and 2).

- question: 'If s XOR t equals 7 (binary: 111), how many bit flips are needed to transform s to t?'
  difficulty: easy
  points: 10
  options:
  - '1'
  - '2'
  - '3'
  - '7'
  correct_answer: 2
  explanation: The number of 1s in the XOR result (111) is 3, meaning 3 bits differ between s and t. Therefore, 3 flips are needed.

- question: What is the minimum number of bit flips needed when s equals t?
  difficulty: easy
  points: 10
  options:
  - '0'
  - '1'
  - Depends on the values
  - Infinity
  correct_answer: 0
  explanation: When s equals t, no transformation is needed, so 0 bit flips are required.

- question: Which of the following correctly count set bits in XOR result? (Select all that apply)
  difficulty: medium
  points: 15
  options:
  - Integer.bitCount(s ^ t) in Java
  - bin(s ^ t).count('1') in Python
  - __builtin_popcount(s ^ t) in C++
  - (s ^ t).toString(2).length in JavaScript
  correct_answer: 0
  explanation: Options 0-2 correctly count set bits. Option 3 gives the total length of the binary representation, not the count of 1s.
