  - question: What is the bitwise OR of 2 and 4?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "2"
      - "4"
      - "6"
      - "8"
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: 2 OR 4 = 010 OR 100 = 110 = 6. OR sets bits that are 1 in either operand.

  - question: What happens when you OR a number with 0?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Result is 0
      - Result is unchanged
      - Result is doubled
      - Result is inverted
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: a OR 0 = a. ORing with 0 leaves the value unchanged because 0 has no bits set.

  - question: For array [1, 2, 4] with k=2, what is the maximum OR?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "3"
      - "5"
      - "6"
      - "7"
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: "Possible selections: {1,2}→3, {1,4}→5, {2,4}→6. Maximum is 6 from selecting 2 and 4."

  - question: Which properties of OR are useful for this problem? (Select all that apply)
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - "OR is commutative: a|b = b|a"
      - "OR is associative: (a|b)|c = a|(b|c)"
      - "OR is monotonic: adding elements can only increase or maintain the value"
      - OR distributes over AND
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: OR is commutative (order doesn't matter), associative (grouping doesn't matter), and monotonic (can only increase). Distribution over AND is true but not directly useful here.
