  - question: "For an array of 4 elements, how many possible pairings exist?

      "
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "2"
      - "3"
      - "6"
      - "12"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "For n=4, number of pairings = 3!! = 3 × 1 = 3.

      The three pairings are: (0,1)(2,3), (0,2)(1,3), (0,3)(1,2).

  - question: "What happens when all array elements are identical?

      "
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Answer is infinity
      - Answer is 0
      - Answer is the element value
      - Problem is unsolvable
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "If all elements are the same value v, then v ^ v = 0 for any pair. \nMaximum XOR across all pairs is 0.\n"

  - question:
      "For array [1, 2, 3, 4], what is the best pairing to minimize maximum XOR?

      "
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - (1,2) and (3,4) with max XOR = 7
      - (1,3) and (2,4) with max XOR = 6
      - (1,4) and (2,3) with max XOR = 5
      - All have same maximum
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: "(1,4): 1^4 = 5, (2,3): 2^3 = 1. Maximum = 5.

      (1,3): 1^3 = 2, (2,4): 2^4 = 6. Maximum = 6.

      (1,2): 1^2 = 3, (3,4): 3^4 = 7. Maximum = 7.

      Best is 5.

  - question:
      "Why is a greedy approach (pairing elements with smallest XOR first) incorrect?

      "
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Pairing locally optimal pairs may force worse pairs later
      - XOR is not associative
      - It's actually correct
      - We need global optimization, not local
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "Greedy fails because choosing locally minimal XOR pairs first can force remaining elements \ninto pairs with very large XORs. We need to consider all pairings (global optimization).\n"
