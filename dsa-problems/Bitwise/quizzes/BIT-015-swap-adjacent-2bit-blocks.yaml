  - question: How many 2-bit blocks are there in a 32-bit integer?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "8"
      - "16"
      - "32"
      - "64"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A 32-bit integer has 32 bits total. Since each block is 2 bits, we have 32 ÷ 2 = 16 blocks (numbered 0 through 15 from right to left).

  - question: "For input x = 6 (binary: 0110), what is the output after swapping adjacent 2-bit blocks?"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "6"
      - "9"
      - "12"
      - "3"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Binary 0110 has blocks [01][10]. After swapping: [10][01] = 1001 = 9 in decimal."

  - question: Which input values remain unchanged after the swap operation?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Only 0
      - Powers of 2
      - Numbers where all adjacent 2-bit blocks are identical
      - All even numbers
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: "If adjacent blocks are identical (like 00-00, 01-01, 10-10, or 11-11), swapping them produces the same result. Examples: 0 (all 00), 5 (0101), 15 (1111), 170 (10101010), 255 (11111111)."

  - question: Which of the following statements are true about 2-bit block swapping? (Select all that apply)
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - The operation is reversible (swapping twice returns the original)
      - It changes the total number of set bits
      - Blocks at positions 0-1 swap with blocks at positions 2-3
      - The operation only affects the lower 16 bits
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: The operation is reversible (A) because swapping twice returns blocks to original positions. Blocks 0-1 do swap with blocks 2-3 (C). It doesn't change set bit count (B is false) since we're just rearranging. It affects all 32 bits (D is false).
