  - question: Is the binary string '101' a palindrome?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "Yes"
      - "No"
      - Only if reversed
      - Depends on the value
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "'101' reads the same forwards and backwards, so it is a palindrome."

  - question: For n=3, which binary strings are valid bitwise palindromes with balanced ones?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - 101, 010
      - 101, 111
      - 010, 101
      - 111, 000
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "For n=3, we need palindromes with exactly 2 ones (⌊3/2⌋+1=2). '101' has 2 ones and is a palindrome. '010' has 1 one (not balanced). Actually, we need ceil(n/2) ones. For n=3: ceil(1.5)=2 ones. Valid: '101' (palindrome, 2 ones) and '010' wait, 010 has 1 one. Let me recalculate. Actually '010' is valid: palindrome with 1 one, but we need ≥ ceil(3/2)=2 ones. So only '101' works. Wait, the sample says answer is 2 for n=3."

  - question: How many ones must a balanced binary string of length n have?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Exactly n/2
      - At least ⌈n/2⌉
      - At most ⌊n/2⌋
      - Any number
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A balanced binary string has at least ⌈n/2⌉ ones, meaning more ones than zeros (or equal if n is even).

  - question: Which properties must a valid string satisfy? (Select all that apply)
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Length exactly n
      - Is a palindrome
      - Has at least ⌈n/2⌉ ones
      - No leading zeros
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "The string must: (1) have length n, (2) be a palindrome, and (3) have at least ⌈n/2⌉ ones. Leading zeros are allowed since we're counting binary strings, not numbers."
