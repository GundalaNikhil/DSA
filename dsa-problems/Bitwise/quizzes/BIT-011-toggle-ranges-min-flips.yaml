  - question: 'What does a "range flip" operation do?

      '
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Swaps two ranges
      - Toggles all bits in a subarray (0→1, 1→0)
      - Sets all bits to 1
      - Deletes a range
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation:
      "A range flip operation toggles every bit in the specified subarray, converting 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s.

      "For arrays A = [0,1,1,0] and B = [1,0,1,0], what is the first step?

      "
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Sort both arrays
      - Identify positions where A[i] ≠ B[i]
      - Count total 1s
      - Find maximum element
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation:
      "We first identify mismatch positions where A[i] differs from B[i]. These are the positions that need to be flipped.

  - question: "If all mismatches are consecutive, how many flips are needed?

      "
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Equal to number of mismatches
      - Exactly 1 flip
      - n flips where n is array length
      - 0 flips
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation:
      "Consecutive mismatches form a single contiguous run. One range flip operation can fix the entire run at once.

  - question:
      "For A = [0,1,0,1,0] and B = [1,1,1,1,1], what is the difference array D (where D[i] = A[i] XOR B[i])?

      "
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - "[0,0,0,0,0]"
      - "[1,0,1,0,1]"
      - "[1,1,1,1,1]"
      - "[0,1,0,1,0]"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "D[i] = A[i] XOR B[i] marks mismatches as 1:

      D = [0⊕1, 1⊕1, 0⊕1, 1⊕1, 0⊕1] = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
