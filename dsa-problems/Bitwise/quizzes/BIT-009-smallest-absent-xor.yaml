  - question:
      "For array [1, 2, 3], which XOR value is always guaranteed to be reachable?

      "
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "0"
      - "1"
      - "2"
      - "3"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation:
      "0 is always reachable because a[i] XOR a[i] = 0 for any element. This is true for self-pairs.

  - question: "Which of the following statements about XOR basis are correct?

      "
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - XOR basis elements are linearly independent
      - Any reachable XOR can be formed from basis elements
      - Basis size equals array length
      - Basis construction uses Gaussian elimination
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "XOR basis elements are linearly independent (correct), can generate all reachable XORs (correct), \nand are found via Gaussian elimination (correct). However, basis size is typically less than array length.\n"

  - question:
      "If the XOR basis has size k, how many distinct XOR values can be generated?

      "
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - k
      - 2^k - 1
      - 2^k
      - k^2
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: "A k-dimensional linear space over GF(2) contains exactly 2^k elements. Each subset of k basis \nelements generates a unique XOR value, and there are 2^k subsets.\n"

  - question: "For array [1, 2, 4, 8], what is the smallest absent XOR value?

      "
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - "8"
      - "15"
      - "16"
      - "32"
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: "Each element is a power of 2 at different bit positions, forming a complete basis of size 4. \nThis generates all values from 0 to 15. The smallest absent is 16 = 2^4.\n"
