  - question: What transformation is applied to each array element in this problem?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Multiply by salt
      - XOR with salt
      - Add salt
      - AND with salt
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Each element x is transformed to x' = x XOR salt (x ⊕ salt).

    question: What is the result of x ^ salt ^ salt?
    options:
      - salt
      - x
      - "0"
      - x ^ salt
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: XORing the same value twice cancels it out (a ^ b ^ b = a).

    question: What is the result if we XOR all numbers in a multiset where every value appears an even number of times?
    options:
      - The total sum
      - The last element
      - "0"
      - A random value
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: XOR is commutative and associative. Pairwise XOR of identical elements always yields 0.

    question: If n=100,000, what is the optimal time complexity of this problem?
    options:
      - O(1)
      - O(n)
      - O(n log n)
      - O(n^2)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A single pass through the array XORing all elements with the salt takes O(n) time.
