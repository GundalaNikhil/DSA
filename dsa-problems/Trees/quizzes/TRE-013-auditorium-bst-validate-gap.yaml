questions:
  - question: What are the BST ordering rules used here?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Left <= node <= right
      - Left < node < right
      - Left > node > right
      - Only compare parent-child
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: BST validity uses strict inequalities with min/max bounds.
    type: single_choice
    id: prq_1
  - question: What additional rule must each edge satisfy?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "|parent - child| <= G"
      - "|parent - child| >= G"
      - parent + child = G
      - parent % child = G
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Every parent-child pair must have absolute difference at least G.

  - question: If the tree is a valid BST but one edge violates the gap, what is the output?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - "true"
      - "false"
      - depends on depth
      - ignore gap
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Both conditions must hold, so any gap violation returns false.

  - question: Which technique validates BST property efficiently?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Sorting all values
      - DFS with min/max bounds
      - BFS by levels
      - Hashing
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Min/max bounds enforce BST constraints in one DFS.
