    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Only leaves
      - Root, left boundary, leaves, right boundary
      - Level order
      - Only internal nodes

  - question: Which boundary nodes are skipped?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Nodes with value 0
      - Nodes with negative value
      - Nodes with even depth
      - Nodes with one child
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Negative-valued boundary nodes are skipped.

  - question: Why must duplicates be avoided in boundary traversal?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - To keep values sorted
      - Because root/leaves can appear in multiple parts
      - Because traversal is unordered
      - Because BFS requires it
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Root and leaves can be included from multiple lists if not handled carefully.

  - question: What is the output for the sample input?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - 10 -5 2 15
      - 10 2 15
      - -5 10 15
      - 15 2 10
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The negative boundary node is skipped, yielding 10 2 15.
