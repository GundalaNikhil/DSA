  - question: Are the target nodes guaranteed to be unblocked?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "Yes"
      - "No"
      - Only if n>0
      - Only if root is unblocked
    correct_answer: 0

  - question: If the LCA is blocked, what should the algorithm do?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Return -1 immediately
      - Climb to the nearest unblocked ancestor
      - Ignore blocking
      - Swap the targets
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: You must find the lowest unblocked common ancestor.

  - question: Which traversal can detect both targets in subtrees?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - DFS
      - Level order
      - Inorder only
      - Heap traversal
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: DFS can determine when both targets appear under a node.
