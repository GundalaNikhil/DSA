  - question: What does the weighted diameter represent?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Sum of all edge weights
      - Maximum total edge weight between any two nodes
      - Maximum node value
      - Minimum edge weight
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The diameter is the maximum path weight between any two nodes.

  - question: Can the diameter path avoid the root?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - "No"
      - "Yes"
      - Only if the tree is balanced
      - Only if weights are zero
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The diameter can pass through any nodes, not necessarily the root.

  - question: Which approach computes the diameter in one DFS?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Keep two best downward paths at each node
      - Sort all edges
      - Use BFS on values
      - Use union-find
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Combine the two longest downward paths to update the diameter.
