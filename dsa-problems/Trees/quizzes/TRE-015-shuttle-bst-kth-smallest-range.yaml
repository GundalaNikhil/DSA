  - question: For values [2,4,5,7,9], L=4, R=8, k=2, what is the output?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "4"
      - "5"
      - "7"
      - "9"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: In-range values are [4,5,7], 2nd smallest is 5.

  - question: Which traversal can enumerate values in sorted order?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Preorder
      - Inorder
      - Postorder
      - Level order
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Inorder traversal yields sorted values in a BST.

  - question: Why can traversal stop early once k elements are found?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Because values are sorted
      - Because tree is balanced
      - Because duplicates are ignored
      - Because BFS is used
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Inorder yields sorted values, so the k-th found is final.
