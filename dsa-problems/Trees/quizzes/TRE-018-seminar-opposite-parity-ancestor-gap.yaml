questions:
  - question: What does "opposite parity" mean in the context of depth?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - One ancestor has even depth, the other has odd depth
      - Both ancestors have the same depth
      - One has positive value, other has negative
      - The ancestor is one level above
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Opposite parity means one ancestor is at an even depth and we're considering the other at odd depth (or vice versa).

  - question: What is the depth of the root node?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - 1
      - 0
      - Undefined
      - It depends on the number of children
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: By standard convention in tree problems, the root node is at depth 0.

  - question: For a node at even depth, which ancestors should we consider?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - All ancestors
      - Only ancestors at odd depth
      - Only ancestors at even depth
      - Only the parent
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: For a node at even depth, we look at ancestors with opposite parity, which are at odd depths.

  - question: What data should be tracked along the path from root to current node?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Only the minimum value at each depth
      - Only the maximum value at each depth
      - Both min and max values for each parity (even and odd depths)
      - The sum of all ancestor values
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: We need to track both min and max values at even and odd depths to compute the maximum difference for nodes at opposite parities.
