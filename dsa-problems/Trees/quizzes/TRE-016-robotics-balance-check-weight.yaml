questions:
  - question: Which two conditions define balance in this problem?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Height difference <= 1 and subtree weight difference <= W
      - Only height difference <= 1
      - Only weight difference <= W
      - Height difference <= W
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Both height and weight constraints must hold.

  - question: Is an empty tree considered balanced?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "Yes"
      - "No"
      - Only if W=0
      - Depends on weights
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The notes state that an empty tree is balanced.

  - question: Why compute height and weight in a postorder DFS?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - To visit leaves first
      - To have child results before processing the parent
      - To match inorder
      - To reduce memory
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Parent checks need subtree heights and weights from children.

  - question: What is the time complexity of the balance check?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(n)
      - O(n log n)
      - O(n^2)
      - O(log n)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Each node is processed once.
