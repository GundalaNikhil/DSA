questions:
  - question: What determines the order within a column?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Value descending, then depth
      - Depth ascending, weight descending, value ascending
      - Weight ascending only
      - Insertion order
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The problem specifies depth asc, weight desc, value asc.

  - question: Which traversal helps assign column and depth to each node?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - BFS
      - Postorder
