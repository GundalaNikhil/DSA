questions:
  - question: What is the right view of a binary tree?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - The rightmost node at each level
      - All nodes on the right subtree
      - Nodes ordered by right child first
      - The node with maximum value at each level
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The right view shows the rightmost node visible at each level when viewed from the right side.

  - question: What does "skip" mean in this problem?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Don't traverse the node's children
      - Omit the node from the right view if its value is negative
      - Remove the node from the tree
      - Don't count the node in the output but still traverse its children
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Nodes with negative values are skipped (not included in output), but we still traverse their children to find other nodes at deeper levels.

  - question: In the given example, why is node -6 not in the output?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - It's not the rightmost node at its level
      - Its value is negative and should be skipped
      - It doesn't have children
      - It's not connected to the root
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The node with value -6 has a negative value, so it is skipped according to the problem requirements.

  - question: If an entire level contains only nodes with negative values, what should be done?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Include them anyway
      - Omit that level entirely from the output
      - Include one of them as representative
      - Return an error
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The problem states that if a level contains only skipped nodes, that level should be omitted entirely.
