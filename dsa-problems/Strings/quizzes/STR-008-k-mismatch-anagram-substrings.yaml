  - question: What does k=0 reduce the problem to?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Counting exact anagram substrings
      - Counting palindromes

      - Counting subsequences
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: No substitutions allowed means exact anagram matches.

  - question: How is mismatch cost computed from frequencies?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Sum of absolute differences
      - Sum of max(0, freq_p - freq_window)
      - Sum of freq_window only
      - Number of distinct mismatched letters
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Deficits in window frequencies give the needed substitutions.
