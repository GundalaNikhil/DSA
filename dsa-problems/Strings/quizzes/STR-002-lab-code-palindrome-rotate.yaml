  - question: Which condition must the character frequencies satisfy for some palindrome rotation to exist?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - All counts are even
      - At most one character has an odd count
      - All counts are odd
      - The string length is even
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A palindrome can be formed iff at most one character has an odd count.

  - question: For input abc, what is the output?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "true"
      - "false"
      - depends on rotation order
      - invalid
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: All rotations have three odd counts, so none can be a palindrome.

  - question: Why does checking frequencies work for all rotations?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Rotations sort the string
      - Rotations do not change character counts
      - Rotations always produce palindromes
      - Rotations only change vowels
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Rotations permute positions but preserve counts.
