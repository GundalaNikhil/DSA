questions:
  - question: When are two strings considered equivalent here?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - They are anagrams
      - One is a cyclic shift of the other
      - They have the same length
      - They share a prefix
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Equivalence is defined by cyclic rotations.

  - question: For input ab, ba, abc, bca, cab, how many classes are there?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "1"
      - "2"
      - "3"
      - "5"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: ab and ba form one class; the three length-3 rotations form another.

  - question: What canonical form is used to group rotations?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Sorted characters
      - Minimal rotation
      - Original string
      - Longest rotation
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Each string is mapped to its minimal rotation to form a class key.

  - question: What is the typical time complexity given max length <= 20?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(n)
      - O(n * m)
      - O(n^2)
      - O(m^2)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Each string is processed in O(m), so total O(n*m).
