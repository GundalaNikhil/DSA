  - question: What is the primary task in the Grid Paths With Turn Limit problem?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Find the shortest path from top-left to bottom-right
      - Count paths from top-left to bottom-right using at most K turns
      - Maximize the number of turns in a path
      - Find paths that make exactly K turns
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The problem asks to count all valid paths from (0,0) to (M-1,N-1) that make at most K direction changes (turns).

  - question: What constitutes a 'turn' in this problem?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Any movement to an adjacent cell
      - Changing from horizontal movement to vertical movement or vice versa
      - Moving backwards
      - Visiting a previously visited cell
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A turn occurs when we change direction - from moving right to moving down, or from moving down to moving right.

  - question: In a 2×2 grid with K=1, how many valid paths exist from (0,0) to (1,1)?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - 1 path
      - 2 paths
      - 3 paths
      - 0 paths
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Two paths exist: (0,0)→(0,1)→(1,1) with 1 turn, and (0,0)→(1,0)→(1,1) with 1 turn. Both use exactly 1 turn, which is ≤ K=1."

  - question: Which of the following are valid constraints in this problem? (Select all that apply)
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Can only move right or down
      - Must use at most K turns
      - Results should be modulo 10^9+7
      - Must visit all cells
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Standard grid path constraints (right/down only), turn limit (≤K), and modulo arithmetic for large counts. No requirement to visit all cells.
