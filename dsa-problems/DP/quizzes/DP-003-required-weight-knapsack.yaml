  - question: What is the primary task in the Required Weight Knapsack problem?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Maximize value while staying under the weight limit
      - Maximize value while using EXACTLY the required weight W
      - Minimize weight while maximizing value
      - Count the number of items that fit
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Unlike standard knapsack where weight is a maximum limit, this problem requires using EXACTLY the weight W - no more, no less - while maximizing value.

  - question: What should the algorithm return if it's impossible to achieve exactly weight W?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - The maximum value achievable with any weight
      - 0 or -1 to indicate impossibility
      - The value at the closest achievable weight
      - The weight difference
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: If we cannot select items to reach exactly weight W, the problem is unsolvable and should return 0 or -1 as an indicator of impossibility.

  - question: Can items be used multiple times in this variant of the knapsack problem?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Yes, it's an unbounded knapsack
      - No, each item can be used at most once (0/1 knapsack)
      - Some items can be reused, others cannot
      - Items can be used up to their quantity limit
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: This is a 0/1 knapsack variant - each item appears once and can either be included (1) or excluded (0) from the selection.

  - question: Which of the following are key constraints in this problem? (Select all that apply)
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Total selected weight must equal exactly W
      - Each item used at most once
      - Maximize total value of selected items
      - Minimize number of items selected
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: The problem requires exactly weight W, each item used once (0/1), and maximum value. Minimizing item count is not a goal.
