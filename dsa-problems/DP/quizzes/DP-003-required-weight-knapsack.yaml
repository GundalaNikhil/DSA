    question: "Can items be used multiple times in this variant of the knapsack problem?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Yes, it's an unbounded knapsack"

    options:
      - option_id: "A"

    question: "What is the time complexity of the standard 2D DP solution for this problem?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "O(N * W) where N is number of items and W is required weight"
        correct: true

        correct: false
      - option_id: "C"

        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "O(2^N)"
        correct: false
    explanation: "We build a DP table of size N × W, and each cell requires O(1) computation, resulting in O(N * W) time complexity."

  - quiz_id: "EDQ-003-Q002"
    category: "editorial"
    type: single_choice
    question: "How should the DP table be initialized to handle the exact weight requirement?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Set all dp[0][w] = 0 for all weights"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "Set dp[0][0] = 0 and all other dp[0][w] = -∞ (impossible)"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "Set all cells to infinity"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Set all cells to the maximum possible value"
        correct: false
    explanation: "With 0 items, only weight 0 is achievable (value 0). All other weights are impossible, so we mark them as -∞ to prevent them from being used in max operations."

    question: "What is the recurrence relation for dp[i][w]?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"

      - option_id: "B"
        text: "dp[i][w] = max(dp[i-1][w], dp[i-1][w-weight[i]] + value[i])"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "dp[i][w] = min(dp[i-1][w], dp[i-1][w-weight[i]])"

        text: "dp[i][w] = dp[i][w-1] + value[i]"
        correct: false
    explanation: "For each item, we choose the maximum between: not taking it (dp[i-1][w]) or taking it (dp[i-1][w-weight[i]] + value[i]), classic 0/1 knapsack recurrence."

    question: "Your solution works for W=100 but times out for W=100,000. What optimization should you consider?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Space-optimized 1D DP array"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"

        text: "Use recursion instead of iteration"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Sort items by weight first"
        correct: false
    explanation: "If W is very large but values are small, we can swap our DP dimension: minimize weight for each possible value, reducing complexity from O(N*W) to O(N*ΣV)."

    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Initializing all dp values to 0 instead of -∞ for impossible states"

        text: "Processing items in forward order for 1D space optimization"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Using 2D array instead of 1D"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Common errors include wrong initialization (allowing invalid states), treating W as a limit rather than exact requirement, and incorrect iteration order in 1D DP. Using 2D is valid, just less space-efficient."
