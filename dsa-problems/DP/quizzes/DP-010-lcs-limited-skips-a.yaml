    question: "What is the primary task in the LCS With Limited Skips in A problem?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Find the standard longest common subsequence"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "Find the longest common subsequence where we can skip at most K characters from string A"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "Find the shortest common supersequence"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Count all common subsequences"
        correct: false
    explanation: "This extends standard LCS by allowing up to K 'skips' in string A - we can treat K characters in A as wildcards that match any character."

    category: "problem"
    type: single_choice
    question: "What does 'skipping' a character in string A mean?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Removing it from consideration permanently"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "Treating it as a wildcard that matches any character in B"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "Moving past it without matching"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Duplicating the character"
        correct: false
    explanation: "A skip allows us to use a character from A as if it matches any character from B, essentially making it a wildcard for matching purposes."

    category: "problem"
    type: single_choice
    question: "Given A='abc', B='xyz', and K=1, what is the maximum LCS length?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "0 (no common characters)"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "1 (using one skip)"
        correct: true

        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "3"
        correct: false
    explanation: "With K=1, we can skip one character in A to match any character in B. For example, skip 'a' to match 'x', giving LCS length of 1."

    type: multiple_choice
    question: "Which of the following are true about the skip budget K? (Select all that apply)"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Skips can only be used on string A, not string B"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "Using a skip increases the LCS length by 1"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "We must use all K skips"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Skips can be used on any character in A"
        correct: true
    explanation: "Skips are only for string A, each skip allows matching (adds 1 to LCS), we use at most K (not exactly K), and can be used anywhere in A."

        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "1"
        correct: false
    explanation: "We can use 2 skips to match 2 characters from A with any 2 characters from B. Skip first 'a' to match 'b', skip second 'a' to match another 'b', giving length 2."

    question: "What is the time complexity of the 3D DP solution?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "O(|A| * |B|)"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"

      - option_id: "D"
        text: "O(|A|² * |B|²)"
        correct: false

        text: "Number of ways to form LCS"
        correct: false
    explanation: "We track the maximum LCS length achievable considering prefixes A[0..i-1] and B[0..j-1], having used exactly k of our K skip budget."

        text: "Use binary search to find matches"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Three options: (1) natural match if A[i]==B[j], (2) use a skip to force match A[i] with B[j], or (3) advance i or j without matching."

        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Hamming distance"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Allowing K mutations in sequence A to match sequence B is exactly the LCS with limited skips problem - treating K positions as wildcards."

    type: scenario
    question: "Your solution gives the same result as standard LCS even when K>0. What's the likely issue?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Not implementing the skip transition that uses k+1 skips to force a match"

        text: "Off-by-one in array bounds"
        correct: false
    explanation: "If results match standard LCS, the skip mechanism isn't working. Most likely the code doesn't include the transition dp[i-1][j-1][k-1]+1 for forced matches using skips."

    question: "Which of the following are common mistakes in this problem? (Select all that apply)"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Allowing skips in both strings A and B instead of just A"
        correct: true

        correct: false
    explanation: "Common errors include symmetric skip logic (should be A-only), invalid skip usage (need k>0), and missing non-skip transitions. 2D DP can't track skip count."

        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Yes, to O(K) only"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Since dp[i] only depends on dp[i-1], we can use rolling arrays to reduce space from O(|A|*|B|*K) to O(|B|*K), keeping only the current and previous row."
