  - question: What is the primary task in the LCS With Limited Skips in A problem?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Find the standard longest common subsequence
      - Find the longest common subsequence where we can skip at most K characters from string A
      - Find the shortest common supersequence
      - Count all common subsequences
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: This extends standard LCS by allowing up to K 'skips' in string A - we can treat K characters in A as wildcards that match any character.

  - question: What does 'skipping' a character in string A mean?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Removing it from consideration permanently
      - Treating it as a wildcard that matches any character in B
      - Moving past it without matching
      - Duplicating the character
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A skip allows us to use a character from A as if it matches any character from B, essentially making it a wildcard for matching purposes.

  - question: Given A='abc', B='xyz', and K=1, what is the maximum LCS length?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - 0 (no common characters)
      - 1 (using one skip)
      - "2"
      - "3"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: With K=1, we can skip one character in A to match any character in B. For example, skip 'a' to match 'x', giving LCS length of 1.

  - question: Which of the following are true about the skip budget K? (Select all that apply)
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Skips can only be used on string A, not string B
      - Using a skip increases the LCS length by 1
      - We must use all K skips
      - Skips can be used on any character in A
    correct_answer: 3
    explanation: Skips are only for string A, each skip allows matching (adds 1 to LCS), we use at most K (not exactly K), and can be used anywhere in A.
