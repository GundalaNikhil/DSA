    category: "problem"
    type: single_choice
    question: "Given 3 posts, 2 colors (Red, Blue), paint costs [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]], and switch cost 10, what's the minimum cost?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "9 (all Red: 1+3+5)"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "12 (all Blue: 2+4+6)"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "15 (alternating colors)"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "6"
        correct: false
    explanation: "All Red: 1+3+5=9 with no switches. All Blue: 2+4+6=12. Any switch adds 10, making alternating patterns more expensive. Minimum is 9."

    type: scenario
    question: "Your solution ignores switch costs and just picks minimum paint cost per post. Why is this wrong?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Greedy doesn't account for future switch costs; DP considers global optimum"
        correct: true
