    question: "What is the primary task in the Auditorium Max Sum With Gap Three problem?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Select all seats to maximize sum"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "Select non-adjacent seats with gap ≥3 to maximize total value"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "Find the minimum gap between selected seats"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Count the number of valid seat selections"
        correct: false
    explanation: "This is a house robber variant where you must maintain at least 3 seats gap between any two selected seats while maximizing the sum of selected seat values."

    category: "problem"
    type: single_choice
    question: "If you select seat at index 5, which seats cannot be selected?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Only seat 4 and seat 6"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "Seats 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "All seats within distance 3"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Only adjacent seats"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Gap of 3 means you cannot select 3 seats before (indices 2,3,4) or 3 seats after (indices 6,7,8). Seats 0,1 and 9+ are valid if gap ≥3."

    type: single_choice
    question: "How does this problem differ from the classic House Robber problem?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "No difference, they're identical"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "Gap requirement is 3 instead of 1"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "This allows adjacent selections"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "This minimizes instead of maximizes"
        correct: false
    explanation: "House Robber requires gap ≥1 (no adjacent houses). This problem requires gap ≥3 (at least 3 seats between selections), making it more restrictive."

  - quiz_id: "PRQ-007-Q004"
    category: "problem"
    type: multiple_choice
    question: "Which of the following seat selections are valid for array [10, 5, 8, 3, 9, 7, 2]? (Select all that apply)"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Selecting indices {0, 4} (gap = 4-0 = 4 ≥ 3)"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "Selecting indices {0, 3} (gap = 3-0 = 3 ≥ 3)"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "Selecting indices {1, 3, 5} (gaps: 3-1=2, invalid)"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Selecting indices {0, 4, 6} (gaps: 4, 2, second gap invalid)"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Valid selections need gap ≥3 between all consecutive selected indices. {0,4} and {0,3} are valid. {1,3,5} fails at first gap (2<3), {0,4,6} fails at second gap (2<3)."

    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "25 (selecting 5 and 20)"

        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "20 (selecting only the maximum value)"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Index 0 (value 5) and index 7 (value 20) have gap = 7 ≥ 3, giving sum = 25. Index 1 to 7 has gap = 6 ≥ 3, giving sum = 30. So answer is 30."

    question: "What is the recurrence relation for dp[i]?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-3] + arr[i])"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-4] + arr[i])"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "dp[i] = dp[i-1] + arr[i]"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "dp[i] = max(dp[i-3], arr[i])"
        correct: false
    explanation: "We either skip seat i (dp[i-1]) or take seat i (arr[i] + dp[i-4]), since gap ≥3 means the previous selection must be at index ≤ i-4."

    question: "Why is dp[i-4] used instead of dp[i-3] when selecting seat i?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "It's a typo, should be dp[i-3]"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "Gap ≥3 means indices must differ by at least 4 (e.g., 0 and 4 have gap 4)"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "To handle edge cases"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "For optimization purposes"
        correct: false
    explanation: "If we select seat i, the previous selection must be at index j where i-j ≥ 4 (to ensure gap ≥3). So we use dp[i-4]."

        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Binary search"

    type: scenario
    question: "Your solution gives correct answers for small arrays but incorrect results for large arrays. What's the likely issue?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Off-by-one error in the gap calculation or DP transition"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "B"

        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Stack overflow"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Incorrect results (not timeouts) suggest logic errors. Gap-based DP is prone to off-by-one errors (using dp[i-3] vs dp[i-4]) that compound with array size."

        correct: true
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Using O(N²) solution"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Common errors include wrong lookback index, missing base cases, and gap vs index confusion. O(N²) is inefficient but not conceptually wrong."

    question: "What is the space complexity of the optimized DP solution?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "O(1) - only need to track last 4 dp values"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "B"

        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "O(N²)"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Since dp[i] only depends on dp[i-1] and dp[i-4], we only need to maintain a sliding window of 4 values, achieving O(1) space complexity."
