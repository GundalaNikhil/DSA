  - question: What is the primary task in the Auditorium Max Sum With Gap Three problem?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Select all seats to maximize sum
      - Select non-adjacent seats with gap ≥3 to maximize total value
      - Find the minimum gap between selected seats
      - Count the number of valid seat selections
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: This is a house robber variant where you must maintain at least 3 seats gap between any two selected seats while maximizing the sum of selected seat values.

  - question: If you select seat at index 5, which seats cannot be selected?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Only seat 4 and seat 6
      - Seats 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8
      - All seats within distance 3
      - Only adjacent seats
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Gap of 3 means you cannot select 3 seats before (indices 2,3,4) or 3 seats after (indices 6,7,8). Seats 0,1 and 9+ are valid if gap ≥3.

  - question: How does this problem differ from the classic House Robber problem?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - No difference, they're identical
      - Gap requirement is 3 instead of 1
      - This allows adjacent selections
      - This minimizes instead of maximizes
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: House Robber requires gap ≥1 (no adjacent houses). This problem requires gap ≥3 (at least 3 seats between selections), making it more restrictive.

  - question: Which of the following seat selections are valid for array [10, 5, 8, 3, 9, 7, 2]? (Select all that apply)
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Selecting indices {0, 4} (gap = 4-0 = 4 ≥ 3)
      - Selecting indices {0, 3} (gap = 3-0 = 3 ≥ 3)
      - "Selecting indices {1, 3, 5} (gaps: 3-1=2, invalid)"
      - "Selecting indices {0, 4, 6} (gaps: 4, 2, second gap invalid)"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Valid selections need gap ≥3 between all consecutive selected indices. {0,4} and {0,3} are valid. {1,3,5} fails at first gap (2<3), {0,4,6} fails at second gap (2<3).
