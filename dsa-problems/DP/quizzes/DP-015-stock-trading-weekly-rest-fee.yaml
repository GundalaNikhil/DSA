        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "O(2^N)"
        correct: false
    explanation: "We process N days, with constant-time state transitions between holding/not holding/cooldown states at each day, giving O(N) complexity."

      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Binary search on prices"
        correct: false

    type: scenario
    question: "Your solution ignores the cooldown and allows immediate rebuying after selling. What's the impact?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Results will be higher than correct answer (overestimating profit)"
        correct: true

        correct: false
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "No impact on final answer"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Only affects runtime, not correctness"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Ignoring cooldown allows more trades than legal, leading to artificially inflated profits. The solution will pass simple tests but fail on cases where cooldown matters."

      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Using O(N) time complexity"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Common errors include missing cooldown enforcement, forgetting fee deduction, and insufficient state tracking. O(N) is optimal, not a mistake."

  - quiz_id: "EDQ-015-Q007"
    category: "editorial"
    type: single_choice
    question: "What is the space complexity of the state machine DP solution?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "O(N) for all days"

        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "O(N²)"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Since each day only depends on the previous day's states, we only need O(1) space to track the 3 current state values (holding, not-holding, cooldown)."
