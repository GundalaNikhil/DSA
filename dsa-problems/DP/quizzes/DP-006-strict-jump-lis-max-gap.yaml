  - question: What is the primary task in the Strict Jump LIS With Max Gap problem?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Find the longest subsequence regardless of value constraints
      - Find the longest increasing subsequence where consecutive elements differ by at most GAP
      - Find the maximum gap between any two elements
      - Sort the array with gap constraints
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "This is LIS with an additional constraint: when extending the subsequence, the next element must be larger but not more than GAP units larger than the previous."

  - question: If the current LIS ends with value 10 and GAP=3, which values can extend it?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Any value greater than 10
      - Values in range (10, 13] only
      - Values 11, 12, 13, 14, ...
      - Only value 13
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: With GAP=3, we can add elements in the range (10, 13], which includes 11, 12, and 13, but not 14 or higher (gap > 3) and not 10 or lower (not increasing).

  - question: What happens if no valid subsequence of length > 1 can be formed due to gap constraints?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Return 0
      - Return 1 (single element subsequence)
      - Return -1 to indicate impossibility
      - Return the array length
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Every single element forms a valid increasing subsequence of length 1, so the minimum answer is always 1.

  - question: Which of the following are valid constraints for this problem? (Select all that apply)
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Subsequence must be strictly increasing
      - Consecutive values in subsequence must differ by at most GAP
      - Elements must maintain their relative order from the array
      - All elements must be positive
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: The subsequence must be strictly increasing with gap ≤ GAP between consecutive elements, maintaining array order. Elements can be negative.
