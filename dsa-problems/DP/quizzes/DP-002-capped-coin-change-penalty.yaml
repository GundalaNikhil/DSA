    question: "What happens when you use more than the cap limit for a specific coin denomination?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "It becomes impossible to use that coin further"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "You must pay an additional penalty cost for each coin beyond the cap"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "The coin value doubles"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Nothing happens, caps are just suggestions"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Each coin denomination has a cap limit. Using coins beyond this cap incurs a penalty cost per coin, increasing the total cost of the solution."

    question: "If it's impossible to make exact change for the target amount, what should the algorithm return?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "0"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"

        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "The maximum integer value"
        correct: false
    explanation: "When it's impossible to make exact change (e.g., target is odd but only even-valued coins exist), the algorithm should return -1 or similar indicator."

    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "The face value of coins used"

      - option_id: "D"
        text: "The order in which coins are selected"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Total cost is calculated based on penalty costs incurred when exceeding caps. The face value contributes to reaching the target but not the cost. Order doesn't matter for minimum cost."

    question: "What type of dynamic programming approach is best suited for this problem?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Unbounded knapsack"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"

      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Matrix chain multiplication"
        correct: false
    explanation: "This is a bounded knapsack variant where each coin has a usage limit (cap). We track penalties for exceeding caps, requiring cost minimization across bounded resources."

        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "O(2^N)"
        correct: false
    explanation: "For each of T amounts, we consider N coin types, and for each coin we might iterate up to max_cap times to track penalty transitions, giving O(N * T * max_cap)."
