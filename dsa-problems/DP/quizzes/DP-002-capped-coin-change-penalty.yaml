  - question: What is the primary task in the Capped Coin Change With Penalty problem?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Find the maximum number of coins that can be used
      - Find the minimum cost to make exact change for amount T, considering coin caps and penalties
      - Count the number of ways to make change
      - Determine which coins should be penalized
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The problem asks to find the minimum total cost (including penalties) to make exact change for the target amount, respecting per-coin usage limits.

  - question: What happens when you use more than the cap limit for a specific coin denomination?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - It becomes impossible to use that coin further
      - You must pay an additional penalty cost for each coin beyond the cap
      - The coin value doubles
      - Nothing happens, caps are just suggestions
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Each coin denomination has a cap limit. Using coins beyond this cap incurs a penalty cost per coin, increasing the total cost of the solution.

  - question: If it's impossible to make exact change for the target amount, what should the algorithm return?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "0"
      - -1 or a special indicator value
      - The closest possible amount
      - The maximum integer value
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: When it's impossible to make exact change (e.g., target is odd but only even-valued coins exist), the algorithm should return -1 or similar indicator.

  - question: Which of the following affect the total cost calculation? (Select all that apply)
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - The face value of coins used
      - The number of coins used beyond each denomination's cap
      - The penalty cost for exceeding caps
      - The order in which coins are selected
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Total cost is calculated based on penalty costs incurred when exceeding caps. The face value contributes to reaching the target but not the cost. Order doesn't matter for minimum cost.
