questions:
  - question: What is the primary task in the Staircase With Cracked Steps and Max Jump problem?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Find the minimum number of jumps to reach the top
      - Count the number of distinct ways to climb the staircase avoiding cracked steps
      - Determine which steps are cracked
      - Find the maximum jump distance needed
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The problem asks to count the distinct ways to climb from bottom to top while avoiding cracked steps and respecting the maximum jump constraint.

  - question: If a step is marked as cracked, what happens when calculating paths?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - You can still land on it but with a penalty
      - You cannot land on that step at all
      - You can land on it but cannot jump from it
      - The step is automatically repaired
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Cracked steps are completely unusable - you cannot land on them or count them in any valid path to the top.

  - question: What does the maximum jump constraint J mean in this problem?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - You must jump exactly J steps each time
      - You can jump anywhere from 1 to J steps forward
      - You can only jump J steps or not move at all
      - J is the total number of jumps allowed
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The maximum jump J means you can take any step size from 1 to J (inclusive) on each jump, giving you flexibility in movement.

  - question: Which of the following are valid constraints for this problem? (Select all that apply)
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 (number of steps)
      - 1 ≤ J ≤ N (maximum jump size)
      - Results should be returned modulo 10^9+7
      - All steps must be used
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: The problem has constraints on staircase size (N), maximum jump (J), and requires modulo arithmetic. Not all steps need to be used due to cracked steps and jump flexibility.
