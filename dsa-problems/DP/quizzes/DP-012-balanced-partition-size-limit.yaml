  - question: What is the primary task in the Balanced Partition With Size Limit problem?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Split array into two equal-sized subsets
      - Minimize difference between subset sums while respecting size constraints
      - Maximize the sum of one subset
      - Count all possible partitions
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The goal is to partition the array into two subsets with minimum sum difference, where each subset's size must be within specified limits [minSize, maxSize].

  - question: What makes this problem different from standard balanced partition?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - It allows elements to be used multiple times
      - It adds constraints on the size (number of elements) in each subset
      - It maximizes instead of minimizes
      - It uses a different cost function
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The size limit constraint adds complexity - we can't just aim for sum/2, but must ensure each subset has an acceptable number of elements.

  - question: Given array [1, 2, 3, 4] with each subset size exactly 2, what is the minimum partition difference?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - 0 (impossible with size constraint)
      - 0 ({1,4} vs {2,3}, both sum to 5)
      - "1"
      - "2"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Subsets {1,4} and {2,3} each have size 2 and sum 5, giving difference |5-5| = 0, which is optimal.

  - question: Which of the following must be tracked in the DP state? (Select all that apply)
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Current subset sum
      - Number of elements in current subset
      - Position in array
      - Maximum element value
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: We need to track position (which elements considered), subset sum (to minimize difference), and subset size (to enforce constraints). Max element isn't needed.
