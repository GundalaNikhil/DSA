        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Count all possible partitions"

    category: "problem"
    type: single_choice
    question: "What makes this problem different from standard balanced partition?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "It allows elements to be used multiple times"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "It adds constraints on the size (number of elements) in each subset"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "It maximizes instead of minimizes"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "It uses a different cost function"
        correct: false
    explanation: "The size limit constraint adds complexity - we can't just aim for sum/2, but must ensure each subset has an acceptable number of elements."

    category: "problem"
    type: single_choice
    question: "Given array [1, 2, 3, 4] with each subset size exactly 2, what is the minimum partition difference?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "0 (impossible with size constraint)"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"

        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "2"

        correct: true
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Maximum element value"
        correct: false
    explanation: "We need to track position (which elements considered), subset sum (to minimize difference), and subset size (to enforce constraints). Max element isn't needed."

        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Impossible with given constraints"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Subset 1: {10, 20} (size 2, sum 30). Subset 2: {30} (size 1, sum 30). Difference = |30-30| = 0. Actually difference is 0, not 10!"
