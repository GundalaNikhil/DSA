  - question: What is the primary task in the Exact Count Subset Sum problem?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Find any subset that sums to the target
      - Count subsets of size k that sum to exactly target T
      - Find the largest subset sum possible
      - Minimize the subset sum difference from T
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: This problem combines subset sum with a size constraint - we must count subsets that have exactly k elements AND sum to exactly T.

  - question: If the array is [1, 2, 3, 4] with T=5 and k=2, which subsets are valid?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Only {1, 4}
      - Only {2, 3}
      - Both {1, 4} and {2, 3}
      - "{1, 2, 2} if duplicates allowed"
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Both {1, 4} and {2, 3} have exactly 2 elements (k=2) and sum to 5 (T=5), so there are 2 valid subsets.

  - question: Can an element from the array be used multiple times in a single subset?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Yes, elements can be reused unlimited times
      - No, each element can be used at most once per subset
      - Elements can be used twice but not more
      - It depends on the input constraints
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: This is a standard subset selection problem where each array element can be included (1) or excluded (0), but not used multiple times.

  - question: Which of the following are valid constraints in this problem? (Select all that apply)
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Subset must have exactly k elements
      - Subset sum must equal exactly T
      - Elements in subset must be consecutive in the array
      - Count total number of valid subsets
    correct_answer: 3
    explanation: The problem requires exactly k elements, exact sum T, and counting all valid subsets. Elements don't need to be consecutive in the original array.
