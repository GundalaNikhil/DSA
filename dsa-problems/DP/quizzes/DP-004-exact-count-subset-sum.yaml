    question: "What is the primary task in the Exact Count Subset Sum problem?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Find any subset that sums to the target"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "Count subsets of size k that sum to exactly target T"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "Find the largest subset sum possible"

      - option_id: "D"

        correct: false
    explanation: "This problem combines subset sum with a size constraint - we must count subsets that have exactly k elements AND sum to exactly T."

    category: "problem"
    type: single_choice
    question: "If the array is [1, 2, 3, 4] with T=5 and k=2, which subsets are valid?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Only {1, 4}"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "Only {2, 3}"

      - option_id: "D"
        text: "{1, 2, 2} if duplicates allowed"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Both {1, 4} and {2, 3} have exactly 2 elements (k=2) and sum to 5 (T=5), so there are 2 valid subsets."

    category: "problem"
    type: single_choice
    question: "Can an element from the array be used multiple times in a single subset?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Yes, elements can be reused unlimited times"
        correct: false

        text: "Elements can be used twice but not more"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "It depends on the input constraints"
        correct: false
    explanation: "This is a standard subset selection problem where each array element can be included (1) or excluded (0), but not used multiple times."

    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Subset must have exactly k elements"

        correct: true
      - option_id: "C"

      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Count total number of valid subsets"
        correct: true
    explanation: "The problem requires exactly k elements, exact sum T, and counting all valid subsets. Elements don't need to be consecutive in the original array."

    category: "problem"
    type: single_choice
    question: "Given array [2, 2, 3] with T=4 and k=2, how many valid subsets exist?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "0 (impossible)"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "1 (one way: indices 0,1)"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "2 (two ways: indices 0,1 or indices 0,2 using value 2+2 or 1+3 is wrong)"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "3"
        correct: false
    explanation: "We can form {2, 2} using indices (0,1) or using the first 2 and moving to next position. Wait - actually with indices [0]=2, [1]=2, [2]=3, we can pick indices (0,1) for sum 4. That's 1 way with distinct indices."

        text: "O(2^N)"
        correct: false
    explanation: "The DP table has dimensions N (items) × k (count) × T (sum), and each state requires O(1) computation, giving O(N*k*T) complexity."

        correct: false
    explanation: "We add the ways to exclude item i (dp[i-1][j][s]) and include item i (dp[i-1][j-1][s-arr[i]]), summing the counts from both options."

      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Greedy selection by stock value"

    type: scenario
    question: "Your solution returns 0 for all test cases even when valid subsets exist. What's the most likely issue?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Incorrect base case initialization (e.g., not setting dp[0][0][0] = 1)"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "Using wrong data types"
        correct: false

        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Integer overflow"
        correct: false
    explanation: "If all answers are 0, the DP transitions are likely correct but the base case is wrong. We must initialize dp[0][0][0] = 1 (one way to select 0 items with sum 0)."

        correct: true
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Using BFS for enumeration"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Common errors include array bounds issues, wrong base case, and using insufficient dimensions (2D can track sum but not count). BFS could work but is inefficient."

        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Yes, to O(1) with careful optimization"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Since dp[i] only depends on dp[i-1], we can use two 2D arrays (or one with backward iteration) to reduce space from O(N*k*T) to O(k*T)."
