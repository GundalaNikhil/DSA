    question: "What makes this a 'constrained' decode ways problem?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "No constraints, it's standard decode"

    options:
      - option_id: "A"

    category: "editorial"
    type: scenario
    question: "Your solution works for strings without zeros but fails when zeros are present. What's the likely issue?"
