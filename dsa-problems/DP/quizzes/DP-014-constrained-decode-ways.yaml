  - question: What is the primary task in the Constrained Decode Ways problem?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Encode a string into digits
      - Count the number of ways to decode a digit string with custom constraints
      - Find the lexicographically smallest decoding
      - Validate if a string is decodable
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The problem asks to count distinct ways to decode a digit string into letters, with custom rules beyond standard 1-26 mapping.

  - question: In standard decode (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26), how many ways can '12' be decoded?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "1 way: 'AB'"
      - "2 ways: 'AB' (1,2) or 'L' (12)"
      - 3 ways
      - 0 ways (invalid)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "'12' can be decoded as '1','2' → 'A','B' or as '12' → 'L', giving 2 distinct decodings."

  - question: What makes this a 'constrained' decode ways problem?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - No constraints, it's standard decode
      - Additional rules like forbidden patterns or required groupings
      - It only works with specific numbers
      - Letters map differently than A=1, B=2, etc.
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The 'constrained' variant adds restrictions beyond standard decoding rules, such as forbidden digit pairs, required patterns, or modified mappings.
    type: single_choice
    id: edq_2
  - question: Which of the following could be constraints in this variant? (Select all that apply)
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Certain two-digit combinations are forbidden
      - Leading zeros make the string invalid
      - Some single digits cannot be decoded alone
      - String length must be even
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Constraints typically involve forbidden patterns, zero-handling rules, and decode restrictions. String length parity is not a common constraint.
