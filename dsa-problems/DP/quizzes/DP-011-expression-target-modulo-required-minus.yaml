  - question: What is the primary task in the Expression Target Modulo With Required Minus problem?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Count expressions that equal exactly target T
      - Count expressions with result ≡ T (mod M) using at least one minus operator
      - Find the maximum expression value
      - Minimize the number of operators used
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: We count how many ways we can place +/- operators between digits such that the result modulo M equals T, with the constraint that at least one minus must be used.

  - question: Given digits '123' with M=10 and T=0, which expressions are valid?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - 1+2+3=6 (6 mod 10 = 6, not valid)
      - 1+2-3=0 (0 mod 10 = 0, has minus, valid)
      - 1-2+3=2 (2 mod 10 = 2, not valid)
      - All of the above
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Only expressions where (result mod M) = T AND at least one minus is used are valid. 1+2-3=0, and 0 mod 10 = 0, with one minus operator.

  - question: Why is the 'required minus' constraint significant?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - It has no impact on the solution
      - It excludes all-addition expressions, requiring tracking of minus usage
      - It makes the problem unsolvable
      - It only affects the final count, not the algorithm
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Without this constraint, we'd count all expressions including all-addition ones. Tracking minus usage requires an additional DP dimension.

  - question: Which of the following are valid operations in this problem? (Select all that apply)
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Place '+' between consecutive digits
      - Place '-' between consecutive digits
      - Concatenate digits (no operator)
      - Track whether at least one minus has been used
    correct_answer: 3
    explanation: We can place + or - between digits (no concatenation in this variant), and must track minus usage. Each gap between digits gets exactly one operator.
