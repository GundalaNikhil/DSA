    question: "What is the primary task in the Expression Target Modulo With Required Minus problem?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Count expressions that equal exactly target T"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "Count expressions with result ≡ T (mod M) using at least one minus operator"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "Find the maximum expression value"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Minimize the number of operators used"
        correct: false

    question: "Given digits '123' with M=10 and T=0, which expressions are valid?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "1+2+3=6 (6 mod 10 = 6, not valid)"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "1+2-3=0 (0 mod 10 = 0, has minus, valid)"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "1-2+3=2 (2 mod 10 = 2, not valid)"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "All of the above"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Only expressions where (result mod M) = T AND at least one minus is used are valid. 1+2-3=0, and 0 mod 10 = 0, with one minus operator."

    question: "Why is the 'required minus' constraint significant?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "It has no impact on the solution"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "It excludes all-addition expressions, requiring tracking of minus usage"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "It makes the problem unsolvable"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "It only affects the final count, not the algorithm"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Without this constraint, we'd count all expressions including all-addition ones. Tracking minus usage requires an additional DP dimension."

    question: "Which of the following are valid operations in this problem? (Select all that apply)"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Place '+' between consecutive digits"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "Place '-' between consecutive digits"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "Concatenate digits (no operator)"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Track whether at least one minus has been used"
        correct: true
    explanation: "We can place + or - between digits (no concatenation in this variant), and must track minus usage. Each gap between digits gets exactly one operator."

    question: "For digits '12' with M=5 and T=3, how many valid expressions exist?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "0 (impossible)"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "1 (only 1+2=3, 3 mod 5=3, but no minus)"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "0 (1+2=3 has no minus, 1-2=-1≡4 mod 5, neither works)"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "2"
        correct: false
    explanation: "1+2=3, and 3 mod 5 = 3 matches T, but lacks required minus. 1-2=-1, and -1 mod 5 = 4 ≠ 3. No valid expressions exist."

      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Minimum operators needed"
        correct: false
    explanation: "We count the number of expressions that, after processing digits up to position i, have value ≡ v (mod M) and have/haven't used a minus (m=0/1)."

      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Ignore negative values"
        correct: false

      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Modulo doesn't apply to negative numbers"
        correct: false
    explanation: "When subtracting, intermediate values can be negative. The expression ((v % M) + M) % M correctly handles negative modulo, ensuring results in [0, M-1]."
