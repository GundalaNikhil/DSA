  - question: What is the primary task in the Flooded Campus Min Cost With Free Cells problem?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Find the shortest path from top-left to bottom-right
      - Find the minimum cost path using at most F free cells
      - Count the number of flooded cells
      - Maximize the use of free cells
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The problem asks to find the minimum cost to traverse from start to end, where we can use at most F free cells (cost 0) and must pay for others.

  - question: What is a 'free cell' in this problem?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - A cell with zero traversal cost
      - A cell where we can use our budget to waive the cost
      - An unvisited cell
      - A cell on the boundary
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Free cells are part of our budget F - we can choose to use this budget on F cells to avoid paying their costs, treating them as free.

  - question: If a cell has cost C and we have free cells remaining, what are our options?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - We must use a free cell if available
      - We can choose to pay C or use one free cell (cost 0)
      - Free cells can only be used on flooded cells
      - We cannot traverse cells with cost > 0
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "When we have free cells available, we have a choice: pay the cell's cost or use one of our F free cell budgets to traverse it for free."

  - question: Which of the following affect the total path cost? (Select all that apply)
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - The cost values of cells we traverse
      - Which cells we choose to mark as 'free'
      - The number of free cells we've used
      - The path length
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Total cost depends on cell costs and our strategic use of free cell budget. The number of free cells used doesn't add cost (they're free). Path length doesn't directly affect cost.
