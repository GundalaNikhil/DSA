    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "We must use a free cell if available"
        correct: false

    question: "Which of the following affect the total path cost? (Select all that apply)"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"

        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "The path length"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Total cost depends on cell costs and our strategic use of free cell budget. The number of free cells used doesn't add cost (they're free). Path length doesn't directly affect cost."

    options:
      - option_id: "A"

        text: "Modulo arithmetic errors"
        correct: false
    explanation: "F=0 reduces to standard grid path. Wrong answers for F>0 suggests the free cell logic is broken - likely not correctly transitioning to dp[i][j][f+1] when using free."
