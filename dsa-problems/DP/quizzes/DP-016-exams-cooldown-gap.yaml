  - question: What is the primary task in the Exams With Cooldown Gap problem?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Schedule all exams on the timeline
      - Select a subset of non-overlapping exams with gap constraint to maximize score
      - Minimize the total exam duration
      - Count the number of valid schedules
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: This is a weighted interval scheduling problem with a cooldown constraint - select exams to maximize total score while ensuring minimum gap between selected exams.

  - question: What does the 'cooldown gap' constraint mean?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Exams must be separated by exactly G days
      - After taking an exam ending at time t, cannot take another until time t+G
      - Must wait G days before the first exam
      - Each exam lasts G days
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The cooldown gap G means after completing an exam at time t, you must wait until at least time t+G before starting the next exam.

  - question: Given exams [(1,3,10), (4,6,20), (7,9,15)] with G=1, which exams can be selected together?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - "All three (total score: 45)"
      - First and second only
      - "First and third (score: 25) or Second and third (score: 35)"
      - None, due to conflicts
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Exam 1 ends at 3, exam 2 starts at 4 (gap=1, valid). Exam 2 ends at 6, exam 3 starts at 7 (gap=1, valid). But exam 1 ends at 3, exam 3 starts at 7 (gap=4>1, valid). We can take 1+3 or 2+3, not all three.

  - question: Which of the following must be considered when solving this problem? (Select all that apply)
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Exam start and end times
      - Cooldown gap between consecutive selected exams
      - Scores/weights of each exam
      - Order in which exams are announced
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: We need time intervals (start/end), gap constraints, and scores for optimization. Announcement order is irrelevant; we sort by end time.
