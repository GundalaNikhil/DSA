    category: "problem"
    type: single_choice
    question: "Given exams [(1,3,10), (4,6,20), (7,9,15)] with G=1, which exams can be selected together?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"

    question: "Why must exams be sorted by end time before applying DP?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "To make the algorithm faster"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"

        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Sorting is not necessary"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Sorting by end time ensures when we process exam i, all compatible earlier exams have been processed, enabling the DP recurrence to work correctly."
