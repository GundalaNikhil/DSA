    question: "What is the primary task in the Keyboard Row Edit Distance with Shift problem?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Count the number of edits needed"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "Find minimum cost to transform string A to string B using keyboard-aware edit operations"
        correct: true

        text: "Determine which keys are on the same row"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Calculate typing speed differences"
        correct: false
    explanation: "This is an edit distance variant where operation costs depend on keyboard layout - characters on the same row cost less to substitute/shift between."

    category: "problem"
    type: single_choice
    question: "How does the keyboard layout affect the edit distance calculation?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "All operations have equal cost regardless of position"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "Substitutions between keys on the same row cost less than between different rows"
        correct: true

        text: "Only insertions are affected by keyboard layout"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "The layout determines which operations are allowed"
        correct: false
    explanation: "The key insight is that substituting characters from the same keyboard row (e.g., Q→W→E) costs less than cross-row substitutions, modeling real typing difficulty."

    question: "What are the three standard edit operations considered in this problem?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Copy, paste, delete"

        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Shift, swap, reverse"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Like standard edit distance, we use insert, delete, and substitute operations, but substitute costs vary based on keyboard row proximity."

    category: "problem"
    type: multiple_choice
    question: "Which of the following affect the total edit cost? (Select all that apply)"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Whether characters are on the same keyboard row"

        correct: true
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "The physical distance between keys on the keyboard"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "The order of operations performed"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Cost depends on keyboard row/position (same row = cheaper), operation type (each has costs), and physical key distance. Order doesn't matter for minimum cost."

    type: single_choice
    question: "If substituting 'a' → 'b' costs 1 (same row) and 'a' → 'm' costs 3 (different rows), what is the minimum cost to transform 'a' to 'm'?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "1 (one cheap substitution)"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "2 (delete + insert)"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "3 (one expensive substitution)"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "4 (multiple operations)"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Direct substitution 'a' → 'm' costs 3. While we could delete 'a' (cost 1-2) and insert 'm' (cost 1-2), the direct substitution of 3 is typically minimum."

    question: "What is the time complexity of the keyboard-aware edit distance algorithm?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "O(N + M) where N and M are string lengths"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"

        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "O(2^N)"
        correct: false
    explanation: "This follows standard edit distance complexity O(N*M). The keyboard cost lookup is O(1) with preprocessing, so it doesn't increase asymptotic complexity."

      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Store as a 2D array of all character pairs"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"

        text: "Keep as a list and search linearly"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "No preprocessing needed"
        correct: false
    explanation: "A hash map from character → (row, position) allows O(1) lookup to determine if two characters are on the same row and calculate position-based costs."

    question: "What is the recurrence relation for dp[i][j] in this modified edit distance?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "dp[i][j] = min of (insert, delete, substitute with fixed cost)"
        correct: false

        text: "dp[i][j] = min of (dp[i-1][j]+delCost, dp[i][j-1]+insCost, dp[i-1][j-1]+subCost(A[i],B[j]))"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] if characters match, else infinity"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "dp[i][j] = minimum of all previous states"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Standard edit distance structure but subCost(A[i],B[j]) is calculated based on keyboard layout - cheaper for same-row characters."

    question: "You're building an autocorrect system that prioritizes typos from adjacent keys. Which algorithm applies?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Standard Levenshtein edit distance"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "Keyboard-aware edit distance with position-based costs"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "Hamming distance"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Longest common subsequence"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Keyboard-aware edit distance perfectly models autocorrect - adjacent key typos (same row) are more likely and should cost less than distant key mistakes."

    type: scenario
    question: "Your keyboard edit distance gives correct results for short strings but wrong answers for long strings. What's likely wrong?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Incorrect cost function for same-row vs different-row substitutions"
        correct: true

        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Stack overflow from recursion"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Wrong answers (not timeouts) suggest logic errors. Most likely the cost calculation for character pairs is incorrect, which compounds with longer strings."

    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Using fixed cost for all substitutions instead of keyboard-aware costs"
        correct: true

        text: "Using BFS instead of DP"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Common errors include treating all substitutions equally, inefficient keyboard lookups, and missing base cases. BFS could work but is less efficient than DP."

        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "O(1) auxiliary space"
        correct: false
    explanation: "The standard approach uses O(N*M) space for the DP table. Can be optimized to O(min(N,M)) with rolling arrays since we only need the previous row."
