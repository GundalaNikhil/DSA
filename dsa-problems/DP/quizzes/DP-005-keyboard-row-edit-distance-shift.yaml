  - question: What is the primary task in the Keyboard Row Edit Distance with Shift problem?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Count the number of edits needed
      - Find minimum cost to transform string A to string B using keyboard-aware edit operations
      - Determine which keys are on the same row
      - Calculate typing speed differences
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: This is an edit distance variant where operation costs depend on keyboard layout - characters on the same row cost less to substitute/shift between.

  - question: How does the keyboard layout affect the edit distance calculation?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - All operations have equal cost regardless of position
      - Substitutions between keys on the same row cost less than between different rows
      - Only insertions are affected by keyboard layout
      - The layout determines which operations are allowed
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The key insight is that substituting characters from the same keyboard row (e.g., Q→W→E) costs less than cross-row substitutions, modeling real typing difficulty.

  - question: What are the three standard edit operations considered in this problem?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Copy, paste, delete
      - Insert, delete, substitute
      - Append, prepend, remove
      - Shift, swap, reverse
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Like standard edit distance, we use insert, delete, and substitute operations, but substitute costs vary based on keyboard row proximity.

  - question: Which of the following affect the total edit cost? (Select all that apply)
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Whether characters are on the same keyboard row
      - The type of operation (insert/delete/substitute)
      - The physical distance between keys on the keyboard
      - The order of operations performed
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Cost depends on keyboard row/position (same row = cheaper), operation type (each has costs), and physical key distance. Order doesn't matter for minimum cost.
