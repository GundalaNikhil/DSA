# GEO-006: Polygon Area (Shoelace)

## 📋 Problem Summary

Given `n` vertices of a simple polygon (in order, CW or CCW), compute its area using the shoelace formula. Output the absolute area as an integer.

## 🌍 Real-World Scenario

**Scenario Title:** Parcel Footprint Calculation**

A GIS analyst needs parcel areas from boundary coordinates. The shoelace formula yields exact polygon areas without triangulating or using floating point, making it ideal for large batches of parcels.

**Why This Problem Matters:**

- Fundamental polygon area computation in graphics, GIS, and simulations.
- Demonstrates cross-product accumulation and sign handling (CW vs CCW).
- Avoids floating-point drift by using integer arithmetic.

## Detailed Explanation

### Shoelace Formula

For vertices `(xi, yi)` with `i = 0..n-1` and `i+1` wrapped modulo `n`:

```
twice_area = Σ (xi * y{i+1} - x{i+1} * yi)
area = |twice_area| / 2
```

The sign of `twice_area` indicates orientation (positive for CCW). Taking the absolute value handles both CW and CCW input; divide by `2` (integer division) to get the area.

### Why It Works

The sum aggregates the signed areas of trapezoids formed with the x-axis. Algebraically, it matches the polygon’s signed area from Green’s theorem.

### Overflow Safety

`xi, yi` up to `1e9`; each product up to `1e18`; summing `1e5` terms fits in 128-bit. In Java use `long`; in C++ use `long long` (and `__int128` internally if paranoid).

## Input/Output Clarifications

- Vertices are in order; polygon is simple (no self-intersections).
- Output is the absolute area (no “.0”).
- If the polygon degenerates (not in constraints), shoelace still computes signed area; constraints guarantee simplicity.

## Naive Approach

**Algorithm:** Triangulate from a root and sum triangle areas via cross products.

**Time:** `O(n)`  
**Space:** `O(1)`

**Limitations:** More bookkeeping; shoelace is simpler and equivalent.

## Optimal Approach (Shoelace)

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize `sum = 0`.
2. For each `i` from `0` to `n-1` (with `j = (i+1) % n`), add `(xi * yj - xj * yi)` to `sum`.
3. `area = abs(sum) // 2`.

**Time Complexity:** `O(n)`  
**Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

## Reference Implementations

### Python


### Java


### C++


### JavaScript


### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forgetting to wrap the last vertex to the first.**
2. **Missing absolute value.** Clockwise input yields negative signed area.
3. **Using floating point unnecessarily.** Stick to integer arithmetic.
4. **Overflow on products.** Cast to 64-bit before multiplying.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time:** `O(n)`  
- **Space:** `O(1)`

## Testing Strategy

- Axis-aligned square (area 4).
- Triangle with known area (e.g., base*height/2).
- Concave simple polygon.
- Large coordinates to stress overflow.
- Clockwise vs CCW input should produce same absolute area.

## Applications

- GIS parcel areas.
- Graphics fill computations.
- Physics: polygon mass properties (area as a first step).
