# GEO-011: Maximum Overlap of Rectangles

## Problem Statement

Given `m` axis-aligned rectangles, find the **maximum number of rectangles covering any point**. Rectangles are closed: points on edges or corners count as covered.

Return that maximum overlap count.

## ASCII Visual

```
Rect A: (0,0)-(2,2)
Rect B: (1,1)-(3,3)
Rect C: (2,0)-(4,2)

Max overlap = 2 (A∩B and B∩C touch, but no point has all 3)
```

## Input Format

- First line: integer `m`
- Next `m` lines: four integers `x1 y1 x2 y2` (`x1 < x2`, `y1 < y2`)

## Output Format

- Single integer: maximum overlap count

## Constraints

- `1 <= m <= 100000`
- `-10^9 <= x1 < x2 <= 10^9`
- `-10^9 <= y1 < y2 <= 10^9`

## Example

**Input:**
```
3
0 0 2 2
1 1 3 3
2 0 4 2
```

**Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**

No point lies in all three; the best overlap is 2.

## Notes

- Sweep line over x with events at left/right edges; segment tree over y to maintain current max coverage.
- Coordinate compress y endpoints.
