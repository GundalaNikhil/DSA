# GEO-010: Line Sweep Weighted Union Area

## Problem Statement

You are given `m` axis-aligned rectangles. Each rectangle `i` has integer weight `w[i]` (can be negative or positive). Given a threshold `W`, compute the total area of all points covered by rectangles whose **cumulative weight is at least `W`**.

Return that area as an integer.

## ASCII Visual

```
Rect A (w=1): (0,0)-(2,2)
Rect B (w=2): (1,1)-(3,3)

Overlap area (weight sum = 3) = 1x1 = 1
Total area where weight >= 2 is 4 (overlap 1 + B-only region 3)
```

## Input Format

- First line: integers `m` and `W`
- Next `m` lines: five integers `x1 y1 x2 y2 w` (`x1 < x2`, `y1 < y2`)

## Output Format

- Single integer: area of regions where cumulative weight >= `W`

## Constraints

- `1 <= m <= 100000`
- `|w[i]| <= 10^6`
- `1 <= W <= 10^6`
- `-10^9 <= x1 < x2 <= 10^9`
- `-10^9 <= y1 < y2 <= 10^9`

## Example

**Input:**
```
2 2
0 0 2 2 1
1 1 3 3 2
```

**Output:**
```
4
```

**Explanation:**

Weight-sum >= 2 region consists of overlap (1 area) plus B-only region (3 area).

## Notes

- Use sweep over x with events at rectangle edges; segment tree over y to maintain length where sum >= W.
- Coordinate compress y to handle large coords.
- Area accumulation: delta_x * covered_y_length.
