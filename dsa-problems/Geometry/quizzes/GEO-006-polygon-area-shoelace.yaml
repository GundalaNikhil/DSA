  - question: Which formula is used to compute twice the area of a polygon?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Sum of distances between consecutive points
      - Sum over i of (xi * y{i+1} - x{i+1} * yi)
      - Sum of squared edge lengths
      - Product of max x and max y
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The shoelace formula sums cross terms of consecutive vertices.

  - question: For a square with vertices (0,0), (2,0), (2,2), (0,2), what is the output?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "2"
      - "4"
      - "6"
      - "8"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The square has side length 2, so area is 4.

  - question: Why do we take the absolute value of the shoelace sum?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Because area is always negative
      - Because input can be clockwise or counterclockwise
      - Because of floating point rounding
      - Because of integer division
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Clockwise order gives a negative signed area; absolute value yields the area magnitude.

  - question: If the vertices are listed in clockwise order, what is the sign of the shoelace sum?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Positive
      - Negative
      - Zero
      - Always 1
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Clockwise order yields a negative signed area; take absolute value.
