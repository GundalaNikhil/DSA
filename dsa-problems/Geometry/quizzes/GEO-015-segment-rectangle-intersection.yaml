questions:
  - question: If an endpoint of the segment lies inside the rectangle, what is the answer?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "false"
      - "true"
      - depends on the slope
      - only if the other endpoint is inside
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Any endpoint inside (or on the boundary) counts as intersection.

  - question: For rectangle (0,0)-(2,2) and segment (-1,1)-(1,1), what is the output?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "true"
      - "false"
      - boundary
      - inside
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The segment crosses the left edge at (0,1), so it intersects.

  - question: If no endpoints are inside, what additional check is required?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Sort the rectangle corners
      - Check intersection with each of the 4 rectangle edges
      - Compute the rectangle area
      - Compare slopes only
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The segment may still intersect the rectangle by crossing an edge.

  - question: If both endpoints are outside and the segment does not cross any edge, what is the output?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "true"
      - "false"
      - boundary
      - inside
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: No endpoint inside and no edge crossing means no intersection.
