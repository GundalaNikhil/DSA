  - question: For exactly two points, what is the minimum enclosing circle?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Center at the origin with radius 1
      - Circle with center at the midpoint and radius half the distance
      - Any circle passing through the points
      - Circle with radius equal to the distance between points
    correct_answer: 1

  - question: What is the expected time complexity of the randomized incremental (Welzl) approach?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(n)
      - O(n log n)
      - O(n^2)
      - O(log n)
