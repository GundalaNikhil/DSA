  - question: What does a positive cross product of (P2-P1) x (P3-P1) indicate?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - clockwise
      - counterclockwise
      - collinear
      - undefined
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A positive cross product means P3 is to the left of directed P1->P2, so the turn is counterclockwise.

  - question: Why is 64-bit arithmetic required for the cross product?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Because cross products are always fractional
      - Because coordinate differences can overflow 32-bit when multiplied
      - Because the answer is a double
      - Because input is stored as strings
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: With coordinates up to 1e9, products of differences can exceed 32-bit limits.

  - question: What does a zero cross product imply about the three points?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - clockwise
      - counterclockwise
      - collinear
      - undefined
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: If the cross product is zero, the points lie on the same line.
