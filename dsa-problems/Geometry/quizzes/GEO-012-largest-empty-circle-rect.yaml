questions:
  - question: Which constraint must a valid quiet circle satisfy for every noise source i?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - dist(C, Pi) <= R + ri
      - dist(C, Pi) >= R + ri
      - dist(C, Pi) == ri
      - dist(C, Pi) >= ri
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: To avoid overlap, the center must be at least R + ri away from each noise disk.

  - question: If there are no noise sources, what is the maximum radius?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Half of the larger side of the rectangle
      - Half of the smaller side of the rectangle
      - The full width of the rectangle
      - Zero
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The best circle is centered at the rectangle midpoint with radius limited by the smaller half-dimension.

  - question: Which strategy is described in the editorial to find the maximum radius?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Exact Voronoi construction only
      - Grid sampling followed by hill climbing refinement
      - Exhaustive search over all points
      - Binary search on radius with no geometry checks
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The editorial uses a grid sampling to find candidates and hill climbing to refine.

  - question: Which rectangle constraint limits the circle radius at a center C(x,y)?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - R <= max distance to edges
      - R <= min distance to edges
      - R <= distance to the farthest corner
      - R <= width + height
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The circle must fit inside the rectangle, so R is limited by the nearest edge.
