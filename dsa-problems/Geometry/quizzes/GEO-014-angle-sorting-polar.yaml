questions:
  - question: If two points have the same polar angle, which one comes first?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - The one farther from the origin
      - The one closer to the origin
      - The one with larger x
      - The one in the lower half-plane
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The tie-breaker is smaller distance to the origin.

  - question: For points (1,0), (1,1), (0,1), what is the correct output order?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - (0,1), (1,1), (1,0)
      - (1,0), (1,1), (0,1)
      - (1,1), (1,0), (0,1)
      - (1,0), (0,1), (1,1)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Their angles are 0, 45, and 90 degrees in CCW order.

  - question: Which comparison strategy avoids using atan2?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Sort by x then y
      - Half-plane partition then cross product
      - Sort by distance only
      - Use BFS on points
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Half-plane partition plus cross product sorts by polar angle without trig.

  - question: Which points are classified in the upper half-plane for sorting?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - y > 0, or y == 0 and x > 0
      - y >= 0 only
      - x > 0 only
      - x < 0 only
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The standard split is y > 0, or y == 0 with x > 0.
