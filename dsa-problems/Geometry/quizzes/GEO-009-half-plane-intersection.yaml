questions:
  - question: What should be printed if the half-plane intersection is empty?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "0"
      - EMPTY
      - outside
      - none
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The required output for an empty intersection is the word EMPTY.

  - question: For the four half-planes x<=1, x>=0, y<=1, y>=0, how many vertices are in the intersection polygon?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "2"
      - "3"
      - "4"
      - "5"
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: These constraints form a unit square with 4 vertices.

  - question: What is the time complexity of the standard half-plane intersection algorithm?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(m)
      - O(m log m)
      - O(m^2)
      - O(log m)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Sorting lines by angle dominates; the deque sweep is linear.

  - question: If two half-planes are parallel and point in the same direction, which one should be kept?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - The less restrictive one
      - The more restrictive one
      - Both are discarded
      - Either one, they are equivalent
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Keep the tighter constraint; the looser one is redundant.
