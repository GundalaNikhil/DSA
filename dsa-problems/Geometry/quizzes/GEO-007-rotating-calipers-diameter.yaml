    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(n)
      - O(n log n)
      - O(n^2)
      - O(log n)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: After one pass around the hull, each pointer advances at most n steps.

  - question: Why does the rotating calipers method require a convex polygon?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Convexity guarantees all antipodal pairs are visited in one pass
      - It only works for triangles
      - It requires integer coordinates
      - It relies on polygon area
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The linear scan relies on convexity; non-convex shapes can hide farthest pairs.
