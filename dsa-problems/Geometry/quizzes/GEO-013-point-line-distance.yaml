  - question: How do you decide the closest point when projecting onto segment AB?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Always use the perpendicular foot
      - Clamp the projection parameter t to [0,1]
      - Always choose endpoint A
      - Always choose endpoint B
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: If t<0 use A, if t>1 use B, otherwise use the projection on the segment.

  - question: For input 0 0 2 0 1 1, what is the output?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "0.000000"
      - "1.000000"
      - "2.000000"
      - "1.414214"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The perpendicular from (1,1) to the x-axis meets the segment at (1,0) with distance 1.

  - question: What is the time complexity of the distance computation?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(1)
      - O(log n)
      - O(n)
      - O(n log n)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The projection and distance use constant-time arithmetic.

  - question: What is the projection parameter t for projecting P onto line AB?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - (u dot v) / (u dot u)
      - (u dot u) / (u dot v)
      - (v dot v) / (u dot v)
      - (u cross v) / (u dot u)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: With u = B-A and v = P-A, t = (u·v)/(u·u).
