questions:
  - question: Do rectangle edges count as covered for overlap?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - No, only interior points count
      - Yes, edges and corners count as covered
      - Only edges count, not corners
      - Only corners count, not edges
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Rectangles are closed, so points on edges or corners are covered.

  - question: For rectangles (0,0)-(2,2), (1,1)-(3,3), (2,0)-(4,2), what is the maximum overlap?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "1"
      - "2"
      - "3"
      - "4"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: At most two rectangles overlap at any point in this example.

  - question: Which data structure maintains the current maximum overlap during the sweep?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Stack
      - Segment tree over compressed y
      - Priority queue
      - Disjoint set
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A segment tree tracks the max count over y-intervals as events are processed.

  - question: During the sweep, how should an event at x2 update the y-interval?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Add 1
      - Subtract 1
      - Add the y-length
      - Do nothing
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: At the right edge x2, the rectangle stops contributing, so we apply -1.
