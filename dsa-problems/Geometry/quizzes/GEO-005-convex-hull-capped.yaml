questions:
  - question: Which hull vertices are discarded in the capping step?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Vertices with interior angle greater than theta
      - Vertices with interior angle strictly less than theta
      - All collinear vertices
      - All vertices on the leftmost edge
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Only vertices with interior angle strictly less than the threshold are removed.

  - question: A square hull has interior angles 90 degrees. For theta = 60, how many vertices remain?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "0"
      - "2"
      - "3"
      - "4"
    correct_answer: 3
    explanation: All 4 angles are 90 >= 60, so all vertices remain.

  - question: What is the time complexity of the full solution (hull + angle filtering)?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(n)
      - O(n log n)
      - O(n^2)
      - O(log n)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Convex hull construction dominates at O(n log n); filtering is linear.

  - question: If three consecutive hull points are collinear, what is the interior angle at the middle point?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - 0 degrees
      - 90 degrees
      - 180 degrees
      - undefined
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Collinear edges form a straight angle of 180 degrees.
