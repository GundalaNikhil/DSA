  - question: What edge weight is used between two points in this graph?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Euclidean distance
      - Manhattan distance
      - Squared distance
      - Chebyshev distance
    correct_answer: 1

    points: 10
    options:
      - "4"
      - "5"
      - "6"
      - "7"
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: The best edges have weights 3 and 3, totaling 6.

  - question: Which technique reduces the candidate edges to near-linear size?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - All-pairs enumeration
      - Four directional transforms with sweeps, then Kruskal
      - Dijkstra on the complete graph
      - Binary search on distance
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The Manhattan MST trick uses 4 transforms to generate O(n) candidate edges.

  - question: Why is building all edges of the complete graph infeasible for large n?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - It requires O(n^2) edges
      - It requires O(log n) edges
      - It only works for Euclidean distance
      - It loses the MST property
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: A complete graph has O(n^2) edges, which is too large for n up to 200000.
