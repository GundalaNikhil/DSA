questions:
  - question: If the query point lies exactly on an edge or vertex, what should be printed?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - inside
      - outside
      - boundary
      - collinear
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Boundary points must be reported as boundary before any winding check.

  - question: For the square (0,0)-(4,0)-(4,4)-(0,4) with query point (2,2), what is the output?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - inside
      - outside
      - boundary
      - clockwise
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: (2,2) is strictly inside the square.

  - question: After processing all edges, when is the point considered inside using winding number?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - When the winding number is zero
      - When the winding number is non-zero
      - When the polygon is convex
      - Only when the polygon is clockwise
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: For a simple polygon, a non-zero winding number means the point is inside.

  - question: If the point is not on the boundary and the winding number is zero, what is the result?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - inside
      - outside
      - boundary
      - clockwise
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A zero winding number means the point is outside.
