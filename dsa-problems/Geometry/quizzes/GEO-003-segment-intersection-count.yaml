questions:
  - question: Which of the following counts as an intersection between two segments?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Only a proper crossing
      - Only overlapping segments
      - Touching at endpoints or overlapping also counts
      - Only if both are horizontal
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: The problem counts endpoint touches and collinear overlaps as intersections.

  - question: For two segments (0,0)-(2,2) and (0,2)-(2,0), what is the intersection count?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "0"
      - "1"
      - "2"
      - "4"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The two segments cross once, so there is one intersecting pair.

  - question: What is the time complexity of the sweep-line solution?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(m)
      - O(m log m)
      - O(m^2)
      - O(log m)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Sorting events and balanced BST updates give O(m log m).

  - question: Why is checking all segment pairs too slow when m is large?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - It requires O(m) memory
      - It is O(m^2) time
      - It only works for vertical segments
      - It misses endpoint intersections
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Brute force checks all pairs, which is O(m^2) and too slow for m up to 200000.
