questions:
  - question: Which region contributes to the area in this problem?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Points covered by at least one rectangle
      - Points where cumulative weight is at least W
      - Points covered by exactly W rectangles
      - Only the overlap of all rectangles
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: We count points where the sum of weights from covering rectangles is >= W.

  - question: What is the time complexity of the sweep line + segment tree solution?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(m)
      - O(m log m)
      - O(m^2)
      - O(log m)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Sorting events and updating the segment tree costs O(m log m).

  - question: Why is coordinate compression used for y-values?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - To avoid floating point
      - Because y coordinates can be very large
      - To ensure rectangles are sorted
      - To reduce the number of rectangles
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Compression maps large coordinates to a compact index set for the segment tree.
