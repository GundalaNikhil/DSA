questions:
  - question: "Odd-Even Linked List usually refers to grouping by:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Node values (parity)
      - Node indices (1st, 3rd, 5th...)
      - Memory address
      - User input
    correct_answer: 1

  - question: What is the core pattern to split a list into alternating positions?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - odd.next = even.next; even.next = odd.next.next
      - odd.next = odd.next.next; even.next = even.next.next
      - Swap values
      - Use a new array
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: We jump two steps at a time for both pointers to link 1->3->5 and 2->4->6.

  - question: How do we reconnect the two groups?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - oddTail.next = evenHead
      - evenTail.next = oddHead
      - They remain separate
      - Merge sort them
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The end of the odd-indexed chain must point to the start of the even-indexed chain.

  - question: Is the relative order preserved in this transformation?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "Yes"
      - "No"
      - Only for odd indices
      - Only for even indices
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Since we iterate sequentially, node 3 stays after 1, node 4 stays after 2, etc.
