questions:
  - question: Two singly linked lists intersect. What shape do they form?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - X shape
      - Y shape
      - Parallel lines
      - Cycle
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Since nodes have only one next pointer, once they merge, they share the entire remaining path (Y-shape).

  - question: How do we find the intersection point if lists have different lengths L1 and L2?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Advance the pointer of the longer list by |L1 - L2| steps
      - Traverse both multiple times until they collide
      - Reverse both lists
      - Use a hash map
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Aligning the starting points ensures both pointers reach the intersection simultaneously.

  - question: If the two lists have no intersection, what will be the result of the intersection finding algorithm?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Return null
      - Infinite loop
      - Return last node
      - Crash
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Both pointers will reach null (end of lists) without matching.

  - question: Calculating the intersection via 'Difference of Lengths' takes what time complexity?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(N * M)
      - O(N + M)
      - O(log N)
      - O(1)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: We calculate lengths (O(N+M)) and then traverse again to find intersection (O(N+M)).
