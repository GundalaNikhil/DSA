questions:
  - question: Since simple subtraction proceeds right-to-left but lists are left-to-right, what data structure helps?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Queue
      - Stack
      - Set
      - Heap
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Pushing nodes to a stack allows popping them in reverse order (LSB first).

  - question: How do we determine the sign of the result (A - B)?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Compare lengths, if equal compare MSB first
      - Always positive
      - Subtract first then check
      - Check last digit
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We must identify the larger number first to ensure we compute (Large - Small) and set the sign.

  - question: What logic handles the borrow in subtraction?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - If diff < 0, add 10 to diff and set borrow = 1
      - If diff < 0, set diff = 0
      - If diff < 0, take from previous result
      - Bitwise XOR
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "Standard elementary subtraction: borrow 10 from the next higher place value."

  - question: Why might the result list need post-processing?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - To remove leading zeros
      - To reverse it
      - To convert to int
      - To sort it
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: 100 - 99 = 001. We want to display 1, so we strip leading zeros.
