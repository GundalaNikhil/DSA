  - question: When rotating a list to the right by K, which node becomes the new head?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - The node at index N-K
      - The node at index K
      - The node at index K-1
      - The last node
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Right rotation by K moves the last K nodes to the front. The new head is the (N-K)th node (0-indexed).

  - question: If K > N (list length), what is the effective number of rotations?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - K % N
      - K
      - N
      - K / N
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Rotating N times restores the list to original. Only the remainder matters.

  - question: What is the key transformation to perform rotation efficiently?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Make the list circular, then cut at the new tail
      - Create a new array, rotate, then rebuild
      - Swap every pair
      - Reverse the entire list
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Connecting tail to head forms a ring. We then just break the link at (N - K % N) - 1.

  - question: What is the time complexity of the circular-link method?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(N)
      - O(K)
      - O(N^2)
      - O(1)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We traverse to find length/tail (N), then traverse to new tail (N). Total O(N).
