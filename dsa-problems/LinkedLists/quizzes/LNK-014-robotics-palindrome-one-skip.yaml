questions:
  - question: To check if a linked list is a palindrome in O(1) space, what must we modify?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Reverse the second half of the list
      - Store values in a stack
      - Add parent pointers
      - Sort the list
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Reversing the second half allows two-pointer comparison from ends towards middle.

  - question: This problem allows skipping exactly one element. How does this affect the check?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - If mismatch at (L, R), check if (L+1, R) or (L, R-1) are palindromes
      - We must try removing every element one by one
      - It requires recursion
      - It makes it impossible in O(N)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: A single mismatch gives us two valid branches to verify standard palindrome property.

  - question: Does checking a palindrome require finding the middle first?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "Yes"
      - "No"
      - Only for even lengths
      - Only for odd lengths
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Yes, to split and reverse the second half.

  - question: Should we restore the list structure (un-reverse) after checking?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Yes, good practice to leave input unchanged
      - No, efficiency is paramount
      - Depends on K
      - It is impossible to restore
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Modifying inputs permanently is often considered a side-effect bug in production code.
