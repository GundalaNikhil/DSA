  - question: To find the middle of a linked list in one pass, how do the two pointers move?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Both 1 step
      - Fast 2 steps, Slow 1 step
      - Fast 3 steps, Slow 1 step
      - Fast 1 step, Slow 2 steps
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: When Fast reaches end (N steps), Slow is at N/2.

  - question: If we want to find the node at index floor(N/3), how should pointers move?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Fast 2 steps, Slow 1 step
      - Fast 3 steps, Slow 1 step
      - Fast 1.5 steps, Slow 1 step
      - Not possible with two pointers
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Fast moves 3x distance, so when Fast is at N, Slow is at N/3.

  - question: For a list with even length (e.g., 4 nodes), using Fast=2/Slow=1, which 'middle' does Slow end up on?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - The 1st middle node (index N/2 - 1)
      - The 2nd middle node (index N/2)
      - The last node
      - Depends on initialization
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Typically, for 1->2->3->4, Fast goes 1->3->null, Slow goes 1->2->3 (2nd middle).

  - question: What is the advantage of the two-pointer approach compared to counting length?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Lower time complexity
      - One pass instead of two
      - Lower space complexity
      - Works on circular lists
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Counting length requires traversing to end then restarting (2 passes). Two pointers do it in 1 pass.
