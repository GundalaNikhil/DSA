questions:
  - question: When swapping node A and B (A->B), what happens to the head if A was the head?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - A remains head
      - B becomes the new head
      - The node after B becomes head
      - Head becomes null
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: If we swap the first pair, the second node becomes the new start of the list.

  - question: Why is a 'dummy' node often useful for pair-wise swapping?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - To store the length
      - To handle the head change logic uniformly
      - To prevent memory leaks
      - It is required by the problem
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A dummy node pointing to head allows treating the first pair exactly like any middle pair.

  - question: How many implementations pointers usually change for one pair swap?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "1"
      - "2"
      - "3"
      - "0"
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Prev->Next, First->Next, Second->Next all needs updating.

  - question: What is the loop condition for swapping pairs?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - while head != null
      - while head != null && head.next != null
      - while head.next != null
      - while count < N
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: We need at least two nodes (current and next) to perform a swap.
