  - question: Using Floyd's Cycle Detection (Tortoise and Hare), if pointer fast == slow, what is guaranteed?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - We are at the start of the loop
      - We are at the end of the list
      - A cycle exists
      - The list length is even
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Collision implies the fast and slow pointers met inside a cycle.

  - question: Once a cycle is detected, how do we find the start of the cycle?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Reset both pointers to head and move again
      - Reset slow to head, keep fast at collision, move both one step at a time
      - Move slow backward
      - Measure loop length first
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The math shows that the distance from head to loop start equals distance from collision to loop start.

  - question: What is the space complexity of Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(N)
      - O(log N)
      - O(1)
      - O(K)
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: It uses only two pointers regardless of list size.

  - question: Can we find the loop length using this algorithm?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - No, only detection
      - Yes, stop fast and move slow until they meet again, counting steps
      - Yes, subtract slow index from fast index
      - Only if cycle is at the beginning
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Once inside the loop, traverse one full circle to count the number of nodes.
