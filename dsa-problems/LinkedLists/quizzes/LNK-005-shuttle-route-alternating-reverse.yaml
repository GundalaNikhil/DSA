questions:
  - question: This problem requires reversing which parts of the linked list?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - The entire list
      - Every alternate segment of size K
      - The second half only
      - Only odd-valued nodes
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: We reverse K nodes, skip K nodes, reverse next K nodes, and so on.

  - question: What is the key challenge when reversing a subgrid inside a linked list?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Storing the node values in an array
      - Connecting the 'before' part to the new head and the new tail to the 'after' part
      - Finding the middle element
      - Calculating the total length
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Re-linking the reversed segment correctly to the rest of the list without breaking connectivity is crucial.

  - question: If the remaining nodes are fewer than K, should they be reversed?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Yes, always
      - No, leave them as is
      - Yes, but pad with dummy nodes
      - It depends on if it's a 'reverse' or 'skip' chunk
    correct_answer: 3
    explanation: If we are in a 'reverse' turn, we reverse remaining nodes. If 'skip' turn, we leave them.

  - question: What is the time complexity of this specific k-group reversal variant?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(N)
      - O(N^2)
      - O(N/K)
      - O(K)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We visit each node exactly once, either reversing it or skipping over it.
