  - question: If we append node '4' to list 1->2->3, what is the next pointer of node 3?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Points to node 4
      - Points to null
      - Points to node 1
      - Undefined
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Appending means attaching the new node to the end of the current tail.

  - question: What is the time complexity of appending to a Singly Linked List if we only have the head pointer?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(1)
      - O(N)
      - O(log N)
      - O(N^2)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: We must traverse from the head to the tail to attach the new node.

  - question: What special case must be handled when appending to a linked list?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - The list is full
      - The list is initially empty (head is null)
      - The list has negative values
      - The list is circular
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: If the list is empty, the new node becomes the head itself.

  - question: In the implementation, why do we use a 'current' pointer to traverse?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - To avoid losing the reference to the head
      - It is faster than using head
      - Required by language syntax
      - To count nodes
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Modifying 'head' directly would lose the start of the list.
