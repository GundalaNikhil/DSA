  - question: When searching for value X, if the loop terminates with current == null, what does it mean?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - X was found at the end
      - X is not in the list
      - The list is circular
      - We ran out of memory
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Reaching null implies we traversed the entire list without returning true.

  - question: What is the worst-case time complexity for search in a Linked List?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(1)
      - O(log N)
      - O(N)
      - O(N/2)
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: In the worst case (element not found or at the end), we visit every node.

  - question: Can we use Binary Search on a standard Singly Linked List?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Yes, always
      - Yes, if it's sorted
      - No, because random access is not O(1)
      - No, unless it's doubly linked
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Binary search requires jumping to the middle, which is O(N) in a linked list.

  - question: Is searching in a Linked List faster or slower than an Array (index-based) in practice?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Faster
      - Slower
      - Same
      - Depends on value
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Slower due to pointer chasing and cache locality issues compared to contiguous arrays.
