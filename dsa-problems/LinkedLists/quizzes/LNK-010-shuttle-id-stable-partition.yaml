  - question: What does 'stable partition' mean in this context?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Relative order of elements in each partition is preserved
      - The list length remains constant
      - Memory usage is constant
      - The pivot element stays in place
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: If A comes before B originally and both are in the same group, A must still be before B.

  - question: To implement stable partition around value X, how many dummy heads are useful?
    difficulty: medium

      - 2 (Less, Greater/Equal)
      - 3 (Less, Equal, Greater)

  - question: After building the two partition lists, what is the final step?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:

      - Concatenate Greater list to Less list

  - question: Can we effectively QuickSort a linked list using this partition logic?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Yes, but random access for pivot selection is slow
      - No, linked lists cannot be sorted
      - Yes, it is the preferred method
      - No, Merge Sort is always better
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Yes, but Merge Sort is typically preferred for Linked Lists due to better locality and no random access need.
