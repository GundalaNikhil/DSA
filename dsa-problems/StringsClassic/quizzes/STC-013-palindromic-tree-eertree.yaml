  - question: The Palindromic Tree (Eertree) is initialized with two special root nodes. What are their lengths?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - 0 and 1
      - -1 and 0
      - 0 and 0
      - 1 and 2
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The Eertree has an odd root with length -1 (to handle odd-length palindromes like 'a' from empty string) and an even root with length 0 (to handle even-length palindromes like 'aa').

  - question: In an Eertree, what does the suffix link of a node `u` point to?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 10
    options:
      - The longest palindromic prefix of the palindrome represented by `u`.
      - The longest proper palindromic suffix of the palindrome represented by `u`.
      - The shortest palindromic suffix of `u`.
      - The parent node of `u`.
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Similar to AC automata or KMP, the suffix link points to the longest proper suffix that is also a palindrome. This is crucial for efficient construction.

  - question: If node `u` in an Eertree represents the palindrome `P`, what palindrome does the child node connected by edge `c` (character) represent?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 10
    options:
      - "`P + c`"
      - "`c + P`"
      - "`c + P + c`"
      - "`P + c + P`"
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Edges in an Eertree represent adding the character `c` to *both* sides of the current palindrome. Thus, the new palindrome is `c` + `P` + `c`.

  - question: What is the time complexity to construct the Eertree for a string of length `N`?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 10
    options:
      - "`O(N^2)`"
      - "`O(N log N)`"
      - "`O(N)`"
      - "`O(N * |Sigma|)` where `|Sigma|` is the alphabet size."
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: The construction is linear `O(N)` because the `last` pointer moves 'deep' into the tree at most `N` times, and the suffix link traversals amortize to `O(N)` overall.
