  - question: In the context of finding palindromes, how does the wildcard `?` behave when compared to another character `c`?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - It matches `c` only if `c` is a vowel.
      - It matches `c` regardless of what `c` is (as long as `c` is a valid character).
      - It only matches another `?`.
      - It never matches any character.
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The wildcard `?` can be replaced by any character to form a palindrome. Therefore, for the purpose of checking palindromicity, `?` is considered equal to any character.

  - question: Why can Manacher's algorithm be used for this problem with `O(N)` complexity despite the wildcard?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 10
    options:
      - Because we can try replacing `?` with all 26 letters and run Manacher's 26 times.
      - Because the wildcard acts as a 'super-match' that doesn't violate the symmetry required for Manacher's initialization step `P[i] = min(P[mirror], R-i)`.
      - It actually requires `O(N^2)` because we need to expand from every center without optimization.
      - The wildcard forces us to reset the radius `R` more often.
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Manacher's optimization relies on the fact that if a palindrome exists at `mirror`, a palindrome of at least that length (clipped by `L`) exists at `i`. Since `?` matches everything, it preserves this 'mirroring' property essentially by being compatible with whatever character was at the mirror position.

  - question: When transforming the string `s` to `T` with separators `#` (e.g., `aba` -> `^#a#b#a#$`), does the wildcard `?` match the separator `#`?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 10
    options:
      - Yes, `?` matches everything.
      - No, `?` represents a character position in the original string, while `#` represents boundaries between characters. They are distinct types.
      - Only if the `?` is at the beginning of the string.
      - Yes, but only in the initialization phase.
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Logically, `?` is a placeholder for a *letter*. It cannot become a boundary `#`. Thus, `match(?, #)` is false."

  - question: What is the time complexity of the solution using the modified Manacher's algorithm?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 5
    options:
      - "`O(N)`"
      - "`O(N log N)`"
      - "`O(N^2)`"
      - "`O(N * 26)`"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Manacher's algorithm is linear `O(N)` in time and space, and the wildcard logic just adds a constant-time check to the comparison step.
