  - question: What does COUNT l r x y return?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Sum of a[l..r]
      - Number of a[i] in [l,r] with x <= a[i] <= y
      - Minimum in [l,r]
      - Maximum in [l,r]
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: It counts values within the value range [x,y] inside index range [l,r].

  - question: Why is coordinate compression needed in this problem?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - To order updates by time
      - To map large values to a compact index range
      - To remove duplicate queries
      - To avoid negative indices
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The data structure indexes values, so compression keeps it small.

  - question: What is the typical per-operation time complexity?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(1)
      - O(log^2 n)
      - O(n)
      - O(n log n)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A segment tree of BITs yields O(log^2 n).
