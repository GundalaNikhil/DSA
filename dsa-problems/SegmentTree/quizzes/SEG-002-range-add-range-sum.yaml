  - question: What does the ADD l r x operation do?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Adds x to a[l] and a[r] only
      - Adds x to all elements in a[l..r]
      - Sets a[l..r] to x
      - Multiplies a[l..r] by x
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: ADD updates every element in the range by x.
