  - question: What does KTH l r k return?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - The k-th smallest value in a[l..r]
      - The k-th largest value in the array
      - The value at index k
      - The sum of the k smallest values
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: It returns the k-th smallest in the subarray.

  - question: After ADD 0 2 1 on [1,2,3], what is KTH 0 2 2?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "2"
      - "3"
      - "4"
      - "5"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Array becomes [2,3,4], so 2nd smallest is 3.

  - question: Why is this problem considered hard?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - It requires FFT
      - It combines range updates with order statistics
      - It uses negative indices
      - It has no constraints
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Order statistics under range adds are non-trivial to maintain.
