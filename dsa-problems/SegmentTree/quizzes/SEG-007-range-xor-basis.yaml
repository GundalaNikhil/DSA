  - question: What does MAXXOR l r ask for?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Maximum element in a[l..r]
      - Maximum XOR of any subset of a[l..r]
      - XOR of the entire range
      - Number of distinct XORs
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The query asks for the maximum XOR achievable by any subset.

    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Prefix sums
      - Linear XOR basis
      - Sorted list
      - Heap

  - question: What is the time complexity per query?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(log n)
      - O(log n * B)
      - O(n)
      - O(1)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Merging bases across O(log n) nodes costs O(B) each.
