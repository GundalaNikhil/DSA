  - question: How can forbidden indices be handled in the segment tree?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Store counts only
      - Treat forbidden values as 0 in gcd
      - Remove nodes from the tree
      - Use a separate DSU
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: If forbidden, use 0 so it does not affect gcd.

    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(1)
      - O(log n)
      - O(n)
      - O(log^2 n)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Segment tree updates and queries are O(log n).
