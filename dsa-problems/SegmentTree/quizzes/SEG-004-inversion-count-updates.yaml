  - question: What is an inversion in an array?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - i < j and a[i] < a[j]
      - i < j and a[i] > a[j]
      - i == j
      - a[i] == a[j]
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: An inversion is a pair out of ascending order.

  - question: After setting a[1]=4 in [3,1,2], what is the inversion count?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "0"
      - "1"
      - "2"
      - "3"
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Array becomes [3,4,2], inversions are (3,2) and (4,2).

  - question: Why is coordinate compression needed?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - To reduce memory for value-indexed trees
      - To keep indices 0-based
      - To sort queries
      - To avoid modulo
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Fenwick/segment trees use value indices; compression maps large values to a compact range.

  - question: Which pairs are affected by updating a single index i?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Only pairs entirely to the left
      - Only pairs entirely to the right
      - Pairs where one element is at index i
      - All pairs
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Only pairs involving index i change after a point update.
