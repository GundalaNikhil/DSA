questions:
  - question: What is returned if no value appears at least T times?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "0"
      - "-1"
      - T
      - The maximum value
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: If no value meets the threshold, output -1.

  - question: If multiple values meet the threshold, which one is chosen?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Largest value
      - Smallest value among those with highest frequency
      - First seen in the array
      - Random choice
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The chosen value is highest frequency; ties pick smallest value.

  - question: Why must the candidate's frequency be verified in the query range?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Because merging is exact
      - Because the stored candidates are approximate
      - Because the array is sorted
      - Because T changes per query
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Candidate sets are small and approximate; you verify actual frequency.

  - question: What is a typical per-query time complexity?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(log n)
      - O(log n * K)
      - O(n)
      - O(1)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Merging a bounded number of candidates costs O(log n * K).
