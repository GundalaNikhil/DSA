  - question: What does FLIP l r do?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Adds -1 to a[l..r]
      - Multiplies a[l..r] by -1
      - Swaps a[l] and a[r]
      - Sets a[l..r] to zero
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: FLIP negates all elements in the range.

  - question: Why must each node track both min and max?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - To handle range sums
      - Because FLIP swaps min and max
      - To support queries on max
      - To store indices
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Negation turns minima into maxima, so both are needed.

  - question: What is the time complexity per operation?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(1)
      - O(log n)
      - O(n)
      - O(log^2 n)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Lazy propagation supports each operation in O(log n).
