  - question: "The 'Rerooting Technique' allows us to solve problems effectively that require:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Calculating a result for EVERY node as if it were the root
      - Finding the leaf nodes only
      - Sorting the tree
      - Finding the MST
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Instead of running N DFS traversals (O(N^2)), we run 2 traversals (O(N)).

  - question: In the standard rerooting transition (moving root from Parent P to Child C), how does the sum of distances change for nodes in C's subtree?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - They get 1 unit closer to the new root (distance decreases)
      - They get 1 unit farther
      - Distance stays the same
      - Distance doubles
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Moving root 'down' towards C puts C closer to its own descendants.

  - question: For minimization of squared distances, why do we track more than just the sum of squared distances?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - We need sum of weights and sum of linear distances to expand (d+1)^2 = d^2 + 2d + 1
      - We just like extra variables
      - It's not needed
      - To handle negative weights
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The expansion of the quadratic term requires lower-order terms.

  - question: What is the time complexity of the optimized rerooting solution?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(N)
      - O(N^2)
      - O(N log N)
      - O(N!)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Two DFS passes (Down and Up), each O(N).
