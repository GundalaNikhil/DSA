  - question: "A Vertex Cover is a subset of vertices such that:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Every edge of the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the subset
      - No two vertices in the subset are adjacent
      - It forms a straight line
      - It includes all leaves
    correct_answer: 0

  - question: "In the DP, if `u` is NOT in the vertex cover (`dp[u][0]`), then:"
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - All children of `u` MUST be in the vertex cover
      - All children of `u` must NOT be in the vertex cover
      - Children can be in or out
      - There is no solution
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: To cover the edge (u, child), if u doesn't cover it, child must.

  - question: "If `u` IS in the vertex cover (`dp[u][1]`), then for each child `v`, we choose:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - min(dp[v][0], dp[v][1])
      - dp[v][0]
      - dp[v][1]
      - max(dp[v][0], dp[v][1])
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The edge (u, v) is already covered by u, so v's status doesn't strictly matter for that edge; we take the cheapest option.

  - question: Can this problem be solved using a Greedy approach on trees?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "Yes"
      - No, only DP works
      - Only for binary trees
      - Only for unweighted trees
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "Processing from leaves up: if an edge to parent is uncovered, pick the parent. This works optimally."
