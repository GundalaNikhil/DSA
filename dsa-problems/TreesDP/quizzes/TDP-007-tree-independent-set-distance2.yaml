questions:
  - question: "In a Distance-2 Independent Set, if we select node `u`, we cannot select:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Its children AND its grandchildren (neighbors of neighbors)
      - Its children only
      - Its parent only
      - Any other node
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Distance-2 implies buffering not just immediate neighbors but their neighbors too.

  - question: "The standard Max Independent Set DP on trees (`dp[u][1]` considers children skipped) is modified here. For `dp[u][1]` (picking u), we sum contributions from:"
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Grandchildren of u (skipping children)
      - Children of u
      - Parent of u
      - Siblings of u
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Picking `u` invalidates children. The next available nodes are grandchildren.

  - question: "If we do NOT pick `u` (`dp[u][0]`), we simply take:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Sum of max(dp[child][0], dp[child][1]) for all children
      - Sum of dp[child][0]
      - Sum of dp[grandchild][0]
      - "0"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: If u is skipped, children are free to be picked or skipped optimally.

  - question: What is the time complexity of the DP solution?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(N)
      - O(N^2)
      - O(N log N)
      - O(2^N)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: It's a linear traversal, assuming efficient child/grandchild access.
