  - question: "The diameter of a tree is defined as:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - The length of the longest path between any two nodes
      - The number of nodes in the tree
      - The maximum degree of any node
      - The height of the tree
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: It's the maximum distance between any pair of nodes.

  - question: "In the DP approach for diameter, for a node `u` rooted at `u`, the longest path PASSING through `u` (turning at `u`) is calculated as:"
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Max height of child 1 + Max height of child 2 + (edge weights if any)
      - Max height of child 1
      - Sum of all children heights
      - Height of u
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The longest path through `u` connects its two deepest subtrees.

  - question: Compared to the Naive approach of running BFS from every node (O(N^2)), what is the complexity of the Tree DP approach?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(N)
      - O(N log N)
      - O(N^2)
      - O(1)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We visit each node and edge a constant number of times (Post-order traversal).

  - question: Does the 'Two-BFS' method for tree diameter work correctly on trees with negative edge weights?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "No"
      - "Yes"
      - Only if the tree is a line
      - Only if total sum is positive
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The greedy property of Two-BFS fails with negative weights; DP is required.
