  - question: "We want to color a tree with K colors minimizing cost. The constraint is:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - No two adjacent nodes have the same color
      - No two nodes in the tree have the same color
      - Leaves must have the same color
      - Root must be red
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Standard graph/tree coloring constraint.

  - question: The naive DP transition for `dp[u][c]` takes O(K) per child, leading to overall O(N*K^2). How do we optimize this?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Precompute the minimum and second minimum scores among all colors for the child
      - Use fewer colors
      - Sort edge weights
      - Use Segment Tree
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: If the best color for child matches 'c', we take the second best. Else take the best. O(1) transition.

  - question: Why do we need the 'second minimum'?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Because the absolute minimum might be the same color as the parent, which is forbidden
      - Just in case
      - To handle ties
      - For variance calculation
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Valid coloring requires color[child] != color[parent].

  - question: What is the space complexity of the DP state?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(N * K)
      - O(N)
      - O(K)
      - O(N^2)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We store a value for each node for each of the K colors.
