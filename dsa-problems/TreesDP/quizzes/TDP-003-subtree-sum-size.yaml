questions:
- question: If we need to calculate the size (number of nodes) of the subtree rooted at `u`, what is the recurrence relation?
  difficulty: easy
  points: 10
  options:
  - size[u] = 1 + sum(size[child]) for all children
  - size[u] = sum(size[child])
  - size[u] = 1
  - size[u] = max(size[child])
  correct_answer: 0
  explanation: Count self (1) plus all nodes in children's subtrees.

- question: Which traversal order naturally supports calculating subtree aggregates (sum, size, min, max)?
  difficulty: medium
  points: 15
  options:
  - Post-order (Children processed before Parent)
  - Pre-order
  - Level-order
  - Random
  correct_answer: 0
  explanation: We need the results from children to compute the parent's value.

- question: This basic subtree DP pattern is a prerequisite for which advanced technique?
  difficulty: easy
  points: 10
  options:
  - Centroid Decomposition or Heavy-Light Decomposition
  - Union Find
  - Dijkstra
  - Floyd-Warshall
  correct_answer: 0
  explanation: Knowing subtree sizes is the first step in HLD (finding heavy edges) and Centroid finding.

- question: What is the space complexity if we store subtree sum for every node?
  difficulty: easy
  points: 10
  options:
  - O(N)
  - O(1)
  - O(N^2)
  - O(log N)
  correct_answer: 0
