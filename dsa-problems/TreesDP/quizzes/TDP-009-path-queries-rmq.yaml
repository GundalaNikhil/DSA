questions:
  - question: "We need the Maximum value on the simple path between u and v. Using Binary Lifting, we augment the `up[u][i]` table with:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "`max_val[u][i]`: Maximum value on the path from u to its 2^i-th ancestor"
      - "`sum_val[u][i]`"
      - "`min_val[u][i]`"
      - "`max_val[u][0]` only"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: This aggregate allows combining results over powers of 2.

  - question: "When querying the path from u to v via LCA, the result is:"
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - max(Query(u, LCA), Query(v, LCA))
      - Query(u, LCA) + Query(v, LCA)
      - max(u, v)
      - Query(root, u) - Query(root, v)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "The path is composed of two segments: u->LCA and v->LCA."

  - question: If we update the value of a node, what happens to the Binary Lifting table `max_val`?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - It becomes invalid and needs O(N log N) rebuilding (Binary Lifting is not dynamic)
      - We can update it in O(log N)
      - Nothing happens
      - It updates automatically
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Binary Lifting is a static data structure. For dynamic updates, use HLD.

  - question: "The space complexity for storing `max_val` table is:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(N log N)
      - O(N)
      - O(N^2)
      - O(1)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Standard size for sparse table on tree.
