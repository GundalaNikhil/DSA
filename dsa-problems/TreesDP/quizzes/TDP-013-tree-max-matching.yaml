questions:
  - question: "A Matching in a graph is a set of edges without common vertices. On a tree, this can be solved using:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Greedy (Leaves-up) or DP
      - Max Flow only
      - Brute Force
      - Shortest Path
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Trees have no cycles, allowing local greedy choices or optimal substructure.

  - question: "In the DP state `dp[u][0]`, node `u` is:"
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Not matched with any of its children (free to match with parent)
      - Matched with one child
      - Matched with parent
      - Removed
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: State 0 usually signifies 'available' or 'skipped' regarding children.

  - question: The Greedy strategy processes nodes in what order?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Bottom-up (Post-order)
      - Top-down (Pre-order)
      - Random
      - By weight
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We optimally match leaves to their parents if available/needed.

  - question: What is the complexity of finding Max Matching on a tree?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(N)
      - O(N^2)
      - O(N sqrt N)
      - O(N log N)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Single traversal is sufficient.
