questions:
  - question: We need the maximum path sum with length between L and R. Why is simple DFS/DP insufficient?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - The state space (Node, CurrentLength) is O(N^2) which is too slow
      - DFS cannot handle negative weights
      - Tree structure changes
      - It is sufficient
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Standard DP would be O(N*N) in worst case (line graph).

  - question: Which technique is best suited for path problems with length constraints on trees?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Centroid Decomposition
      - Binary Lifting
      - Heavy-Light Decomposition
      - Prim's Algorithm
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: It decomposes the problem into paths passing through a root, solving efficiently.

  - question: "In Centroid Decomposition, finding the best path through a centroid often involves:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Merging paths from different subtrees using a data structure (e.g., Segment Tree or Sliding Window)
      - Checking all pairs of nodes (O(N^2))
      - Just taking the max of subtrees
      - Random sampling
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We collect paths from children (depth, sum) and query for compatible paths.

  - question: What is the time complexity of the Centroid Decomposition approach for this problem?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(N log N) or O(N log^2 N)
      - O(N^2)
      - O(N)
      - O(N^3)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Depends on the merge step, but standard CD adds a log factor.
