questions:
  - question: "Euler Tour (DFS linearization) allows us to represent a subtree rooted at `u` as:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - A contiguous range [in[u], out[u]]
      - A set of random indices
      - Two intervals
      - A linked list
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Entry and Exit times define the range encompassing all descendants.

  - question: To support 'Subtree Add' and 'Point Query', which Fenwick Tree variation is used?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Range Update, Point Query (Difference Array method)
      - Point Update, Range Query
      - Range Update, Range Query
      - Standard Sum
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: A range add [L, R] implies update(L, +v) and update(R+1, -v).

  - question: "A Point Query at node `u` in this system translates to:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Prefix Sum up to index `in[u]`
      - Value at index `in[u]`
      - Sum of [in[u], out[u]]
      - Difference between in and out
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The value at a point is the accumulation of all range updates covering it.

  - question: Why should we be careful with 1-based indexing in Fenwick Trees?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Fenwick Tree logic (x & -x) relies on 1-based indexing; 0 causes infinite loops
      - It doesn't matter
      - Arrays are 0-based
      - Only for Java
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Updating index 0 (`0 & -0`) doesn't progress.
