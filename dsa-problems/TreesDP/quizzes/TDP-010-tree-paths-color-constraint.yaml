questions:
  - question: "To count paths that contain AT LEAST one node of color C, it is often simpler to Count:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Total paths - Paths containing NO node of color C
      - Paths with exactly one node of color C
      - Paths with all nodes of color C
      - Paths starting with color C
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Principle of inclusion-exclusion / Complementary counting.

  - question: "If we remove all nodes of color C from the tree, the remaining structure is:"
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - A forest of disjoint trees (components)
      - A single smaller tree
      - A cyclic graph
      - Empty
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Removing nodes breaks the connectivity.

  - question: In a component of size S (where no node has color C), how many valid paths exist (including length 0)?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - S * (S + 1) / 2
      - S
      - S^2
      - 2^S
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Number of pairs (i, j) with i <= j is S(S+1)/2.

  - question: With N nodes and K colors, if we want to solve this for ALL colors efficiently, what is the bottleneck?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Iterating over N nodes for each of K colors (O(NK) total)
      - Sorting colors
      - Reading input
      - Tree construction
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: If K is large, O(NK) is slow. Optimizations exist but require advanced techniques.
