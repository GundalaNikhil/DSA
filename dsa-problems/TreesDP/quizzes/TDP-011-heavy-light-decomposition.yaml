questions:
  - question: "A 'Heavy Edge' connects a node to:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - The child with the largest subtree size
      - The child with the maximum edge weight
      - Any child
      - The parent
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: This partitions the tree into heavy chains.

  - question: Any path from the root to a leaf intersects at most how many light edges?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(log N)
      - O(N)
      - O(sqrt N)
      - O(1)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Each light edge traversal implies the subtree size at least doubles, limiting occurrences to log N.

  - question: "HLD allows us to linearize the tree so we can apply:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Segment Tree or Fenwick Tree on the heavy chains
      - Dijkstra
      - Sorting
      - Hashing
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Nodes in a heavy chain are given consecutive IDs.

  - question: "Combined with a Segment Tree, HLD supports path updates and queries in:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(log^2 N)
      - O(log N)
      - O(N)
      - O(1)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: log N chains, each requiring a log N Segment Tree query.
