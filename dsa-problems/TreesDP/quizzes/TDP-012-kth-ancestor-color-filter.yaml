questions:
  - question: We look for the K-th ancestor of `u` having color `C`. Does `u` itself count?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Yes, if u has color C, it is the 1st ancestor
      - No, strictly strictly above u
      - Only if K=0
      - Depends on implementation
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Standard ancestor definitions often include self; problem statement clarifies 'u is 1st'.

  - question: "If we simply walk up the tree using parent pointers to find the K-th colored node, the worst-case complexity per query is:"
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(N) (or O(Depth))
      - O(log N)
      - O(1)
      - O(K)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: A skewed line graph requires traversing all nodes.

  - question: "To optimize this for static trees, we could preprocess:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Binary lifting tables for EACH color (expensive on memory) or color-specific parent pointers
      - Nothing
      - BFS order
      - DFS order
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Jumping directly to the next node of the SAME color speeds up the process.

  - question: "If `count` of color C ancestors < K, we return:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - -1 or Not Found
      - Root
      - u
      - Parent of root
