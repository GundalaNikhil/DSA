  - question: "Centroid Decomposition works by recursively splitting the tree at the centroid, producing a 'Centroid Tree' of height:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(log N)
      - O(N)
      - O(sqrt N)
      - O(1)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Each split ensures subtrees are at most half the size.

  - question: "This technique is particularly useful for:"
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Path queries/updates where paths are decomposed into two segments going up to an ancestor in the Centroid Tree
      - Finding LCA
      - Finding MST
      - Subtree sum queries
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Any path u-v in the original tree passes through the LCA of u,v in the Centroid Tree.

  - question: What is the construction time complexity of the Centroid Tree?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(N log N)
      - O(N^2)
      - O(N)
      - O(log N)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: At each level (log N levels), we process O(N) nodes.
