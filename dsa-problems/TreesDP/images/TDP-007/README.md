# Image Generation Prompts for TDP-007: Distance-2 Independent Set on Tree

## Required Images

### 1. problem-illustration.png

**Prompt:** Create a tree with 8 nodes showing distance-2 independent set. Highlight 2-3 selected nodes in green that are at distance ≥3 from each other. Show distances between selected nodes. Mark invalid selections (nodes too close) with red X.

### 2. real-world-scenario.png

**Prompt:** Cell tower placement infographic showing towers on a map with interference zones. Selected tower locations in green, coverage areas shown. Text: "Minimize interference, maximize coverage".

### 3. algorithm-visualization.png

**Prompt:** Three-panel diagram showing DP states: State 0 (not selected, no child selected), State 1 (not selected, child selected), State 2 (selected). Show transitions and recurrences.

### 4. example-walkthrough.png

**Prompt:** Step-by-step solution for the 5-node chain example. Show all valid selections and compute maximum weight.

### 5. complexity-comparison.png

**Prompt:** Brute force O(2^n) vs DP O(n) comparison with performance graphs.

### 6. common-mistakes.png

**Prompt:** Three panels: wrong distance interpretation, incorrect state transitions, missing edge cases.
