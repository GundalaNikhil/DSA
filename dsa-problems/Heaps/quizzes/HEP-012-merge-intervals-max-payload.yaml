    question: If intervals are [1, 5, p=10] and [4, 8, p=20], what is the resulting merged interval?
    options:
      - "[1, 8, p=30]"
      - "[1, 8, p=20]"
      - "[4, 5, p=10]"
      - "[1, 4, p=20]"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Overlap exists (4 < 5). Range is [min(1,4), max(5,8)] = [1,8]. Payload is max(10,20) = 20.

    question: What is the necessary preprocessing step before merging intervals greedily?
    options:
      - Sort by payload
      - Sort by start time
      - Sort by duration
      - Filter out negative values
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Sorting by start time ensures that we only need to check the next interval for an overlap with the currently merging range.

    question: During merging, if curr_end < next_start, what should happen?
    options:
      - Merge them anyway
      - Discard the next interval
      - Finish the current merged interval and start a new one
      - Increase current_end
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: If there is no overlap (next start is after current end), the current merged group is finished.

    question: What is the space complexity to store the merged intervals in the worst case?
    options:
      - O(1)
      - O(log N)
      - O(N)
      - O(N^2)
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: If no intervals overlap, the number of merged intervals is N, requiring O(N) space.
