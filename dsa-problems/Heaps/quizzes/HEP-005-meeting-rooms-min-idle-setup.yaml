    question: If a meeting ends at t=10 and the next starts at t=13, with setup time s=1, what is the slack?
    options:
      - "3"
      - "2"
      - "1"
      - "0"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Slack = next_start - (prev_end + s) = 13 - (10 + 1) = 2.

    question: What is the correct sorting order for meetings to minimize total slack?
    options:
      - By end time

    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Sorting by start time allows us to process meetings greedily as they arrive.

    question: Which data structure helps find the room that becomes available latest but still before the current meeting's start time?
    options:
      - Max-heap
      - Min-heap
      - Binary Search Tree (or TreeSet/std::set)
      - Stack
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: A balanced BST allows finding the 'floor' of the start time among room availability times in O(log K) time.

    question: Why should we pick the room available 'latest but still <= start' instead of any available room?
    options:
      - To minimize the slack generated by this specific assignment
      - To leave earlier rooms for longer meetings
      - To reduce heap size
      - It doesn't matter, any room works
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Picking the room with the latest availability before the start time minimizes the gap (slack) for that specific assignment.
