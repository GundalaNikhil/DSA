    question: If q=3 and T=2, with operations ADD 10, ADD 20, MEDIAN, what is the output?
    options:
      - "10"
      - "15"
      - NA
      - EMPTY
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Size is 2, which is not less than T(2). The lower median of {10, 20} is 10.

    question: Which combination of data structures is most efficient for tracking the median with deletions?
    options:
      - Sorted array
      - Min-heap and Max-heap with hash maps for lazy deletion
      - Single Max-heap and a frequency array
      - Balanced Binary Search Tree without frequency counts
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Two heaps (max-heap for lower half, min-heap for upper half) allow O(log N) median access. Hash maps enable O(log N) lazy deletions.

    question: In lazy deletion, when should an element actually be popped from the heap top?
    options:
      - Immediately when DEL is called
      - When the heap top is the element marked for deletion
      - Only when the heap size reaches a certain threshold
      - After every ADD operation
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Lazy deletion marks elements as 'to be deleted'. They are only popped when they bubble up to the top of the heap.

    question: If a multiset is {10, 20, 30} and T=4, what does a MEDIAN operation return?
    options:
      - "20"
      - "10"
      - NA
      - EMPTY
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: The size (3) is strictly less than the threshold T (4), so the output must be NA.
