    question: If EXTRACT returns '1 id1', what was the key value of id1?
    options:
      - "0"
      - "1"
      - id1
      - EMPTY
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The output format is 'value id', so '1' is the key value.

    question: To support Decrease-Key in O(log N), what additional data structure is required alongside the heap?
    options:
      - A stack of ids
      - A map from 'id' to its current index in the heap array
      - A second heap
      - A linked list
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The map (or position tracking array) allows us to find where 'id1' is in the heap instantly, so we can bubble it up after decreasing its key.

    question: If two ids 'apple' and 'banana' both have key value 10, which one is extracted first?
    options:
      - apple (lexicographically smaller)
      - banana
      - Randomly chosen
      - The one inserted first
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The problem states that if multiple ids have the same key, return the lexicographically smallest id.

    question: What happens when you DECREASE a key beyond the current minimum?
    options:
      - It causes an error
      - The element bubbles up to the root (index 0 or 1)
      - The element bubbles down
      - The heap remains unchanged
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Decreasing a key can only move an element 'higher' (towards the root) in a min-heap.
