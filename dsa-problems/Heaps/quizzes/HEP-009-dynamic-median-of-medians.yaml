    question: If a group contains {10, 20, 30}, what is its median?
    options:
      - "10"
      - "20"
      - "30"
      - "15"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: For {10, 20, 30}, the middle element is 20.

    question: To efficiently merge two groups (each with two heaps), which strategy is used?
    options:
      - Rebuild all heaps from scratch
      - "Small-to-large merging: insert elements of the smaller group into the larger group"
      - Concatenate the heaps and heapify
      - Copy both into a sorted array
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Small-to-large merging ensures that each element is moved at most O(log N) times, giving O(N log^2 N) total for all merges.

    question: What is the role of Union-Find in this problem?
    options:
      - To track which groups are merged together
      - To find the minimum element
      - To sort the elements
      - To detect cycles
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Union-Find tracking group IDs allows us to quickly find the representative group (and its heaps) after multiple merges.

    question: If there are G groups with medians {M1, M2, ... MG}, how is the 'median of medians' efficiently updated when a group median changes?
    options:
      - It's impossible to do efficiently
      - By maintaining a separate pair of heaps for the G medians
      - By re-sorting all medians
      - By taking the average
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Just as we track the median of elements in a group, we can track the median of all group medians using two more heaps.
