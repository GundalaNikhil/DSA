    question: What is the median of the merged set {1, 3} and {2, 4}?
    options:
      - "2"
      - "3"
      - "2.5"
      - "1.5"
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: "Merged and sorted: [1, 2, 3, 4]. Middle elements are 2 and 3. Average is (2+3)/2 = 2.5."

    question: Does the fact that the inputs are already heaps significantly change the O(N log N) sorting requirement for the median?
    options:
      - Yes, it becomes O(N)
      - No, because the heaps are separate and unorganized relative to each other
      - Yes, it becomes O(log N)
      - Only if they are both min-heaps
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: While they are heaps, we still need to combine them and find the overall middle, which in a general case requires re-balancing or sorting.

    question: What is the time complexity of the two-heap approach for finding the median of N total elements?
    options:
      - O(N)
      - O(N log N)
      - O(1)
      - O(N^2)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Inserting each element into the two-heap structure takes O(log N), resulting in O(N log N) total.

    question: For a merged set of size 100, which indices (1-based) define the median?
    options:
      - 50th
      - 51st
      - Average of 50th and 51st
      - 1st and 100th
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: For an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements (n/2 and n/2 + 1).
