    question: If current capital = 2 and risk budget = 3, can you select a project with cost 3 and risk 1?
    options:
      - Yes, because risk 1 < 3
      - No, because capital (2) < cost (3)
      - Yes, if profit > 5
      - Only as the first project
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A project can only be selected if its cost is less than or equal to current capital.

    question: What is the greedy heuristic to maximize final capital at each step?
    options:
      - Select the project with the lowest risk
      - Select the project with the highest profit among affordable/valid ones
      - Select the project with the lowest cost
      - Select the project with the highest risk
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Picking the highest profit project among those you can afford and that fit the risk budget is the optimal greedy strategy.

    question: Which combination of structures is best for checking affordability efficiently?
    options:
      - Sort projects by cost and use a max-heap for profits of affordable projects
      - Unordered list and linear search
      - Min-heap for costs
      - Stack for risk
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Sorting by cost allows us to 'unlock' projects as capital increases. A max-heap then lets us pick the best profit among those unlocked.

    question: What is the total time complexity for N projects and K selections?
    options:
      - O(N * K)
      - O(N log N)
      - O(N^2)
      - O(K log N)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Sorting takes O(N log N). Each project is added to and removed from the heap at most once (O(log N)), resulting in O(N log N) total.
