    question: If point P is (3, 4) with weight w=5, what is its weighted distance?
    options:
      - "5"
      - 25/5 = 5
      - "7"
      - "1"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: x^2 + y^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25. Weighted distance = 25 / 5 = 5.

    question: Which data structure is most appropriate for maintaining the k smallest distances in a stream?
    options:
      - Min-heap of size k
      - Max-heap of size k
      - Stack
      - Double-ended queue
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A max-heap of size k allows us to keep the k smallest elements. If a new element is smaller than the current max (top), we replace the top.

    question: To avoid floating point errors when comparing (d1/w1) and (d2/w2), what should you do?
    options:
      - Use 'long double'
      - "Cross-multiply: check if d1 * w2 < d2 * w1"
      - Truncate to integers
      - Round to 6 decimal places
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Cross-multiplication keeps everything in integer land (given weights are positive), avoiding precision issues.

    type: single_choice
    difficulty: hard
    points: 20
    question: What is the per-addition complexity to maintain the top k points?
    options:
      - O(k)
      - O(log k)
      - O(k log q)
      - O(1)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Each new point is either ignored or inserted into the max-heap of size k, taking O(log k) time.
