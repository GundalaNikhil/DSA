    question: If current energy is 5, can you start a task with duration 6 and energy gain 10?
    options:
      - Yes, because net gain is (+4)
      - No, because current energy (5) < duration (6)
      - Only if it is the first task
      - Depends on total tasks
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The problem states you can only start a task if your current energy is at least its duration.

    question: For tasks that you can currently afford, what is the best greedy choice to maximize future task capacity?
    options:
      - Task with smallest energy gain
      - Task with largest duration
      - Task with largest energy gain (g_i)
      - Task with largest net gain (g_i - d_i)
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Choosing the task with the highest energy gain increases your future energy pool the most, allowing you to afford more tasks later.

    question: What is the time complexity to solve this problem for N tasks using a heap?
    options:
      - O(N)
      - O(N log N)
      - O(N^2)
      - O(log N)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Sorting tasks by duration and using a heap to pick the best energy gain results in O(N log N).

    question: If you have multiple tasks you can afford, and all have the same energy gain, which should you pick first?
    options:
      - The one with the smallest duration
      - The one with the largest duration
      - It doesn't matter
      - Skip both
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Picking the smallest duration first leaves you with more energy immediately, though with the same gain, O(N log N) logic usually manages this by processing all affordable tasks.
