    question: What is the penalty for connecting a Class 1 (critical) rope with a Class 3 (spare) rope?
    options:
      - "0"
      - "1"
      - "2"
      - "3"
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: The penalty rule states that if classes are 1 and 3, the penalty is 2.

    question: If you connect a Class 2 rope with a Class 3 rope, what is the priority class of the resulting rope?
    options:
      - Class 2
      - Class 3
      - Class 1
      - Class 5
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The resulting rope inherits the higher priority (smaller class number), which is Class 2.

    question: To maximize total strength, which strategy is generally best regarding penalties?
    options:
      - Merge ropes from different classes first
      - Prefer same-class merges to minimize penalties
      - Always merge the smallest ropes regardless of class
      - Always merge Class 1 ropes last
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Same-class merges haben 0 penalty, preserving more strength for the final rope.

    question: What is the time complexity of the optimal merging solution using max-heaps per class?
    options:
      - O(N)
      - O(N log N)
      - O(N^2)
      - O(log N)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Heap operations (push/pop) take O(log N). Performing them for N ropes results in O(N log N).
