  question: If A = [9, 7], B = [8, 3], and d = 1, which products are valid?
  options:
  - 9*8
  - 9*3 and 7*8
  - 7*3
  - All of them
  correct_answer: 1
  explanation: '|0-0|=0 < 1 (invalid). |0-1|=1 >= 1 (9*3=27 valid). |1-0|=1 >= 1 (7*8=56 valid). |1-1|=0 < 1 (7*3=21 invalid).'

  question: Why can't we simply take the top K of A and top K of B?
  options:
  - The products might not be the largest due to the index gap constraint
  - It would be too fast
  - The index gap only applies to B
  - A and B are not sorted
  correct_answer: 0
  explanation: The constraint |i - j| >= d excludes the very best pairs (like i=0, j=0) if d > 0, so we must search specifically for large valid products.

  question: In the heap-based search for largest products, what are the candidates after popping (i, j)?
  options:
  - (i+1, j+1)
  - (i+1, j) and (i, j+1), provided they satisfy the index gap
  - Only (0, 0)
  - The entire array
  correct_answer: 1
  explanation: Since A and B are sorted non-increasingly, the next largest products must come from slightly larger indices i+1 or j+1.

  question: How do you handle negative values in A and B when finding largest products?
  options:
  - Ignore them
  - Take absolute values
  - Split into positive and negative cases (pos*pos and neg*neg can both be large)
  - Negatives cannot produce large products
  correct_answer: 2
  explanation: A large positive product can result from two large positive numbers or two large negative numbers (e.g., -10 * -10 = 100). Both cases must be checked.
