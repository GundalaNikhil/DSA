    question: If Task A is executed at t=0 with cooldown k=1, what is the earliest next time slot it can be executed?
    options:
      - t=1
      - t=2
      - t=3
      - t=0.5
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Cooldown k=1 means A is blocked for the next 1 slot (t=1). It becomes available again at t=2.

    question: To maximize the total priority score, which available task should be prioritized in a slot?
    options:
      - The one with the smallest cooldown
      - The one with the highest priority weight
      - The one with the most remaining tasks
      - The one with the smallest id
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Choosing the highest priority task available in the current slot maximizes the score gain for that slot.

    question: How can we efficiently manage tasks that are currently cooling down?
    options:
      - Check all tasks in every slot
      - Use a queue to store (time_available, task_id)
      - Re-sort the tasks
      - Delete them and re-insert
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A queue sorted by availability time allows us to quickly move tasks back into the 'available' heap as time progresses.

    question: What is the time complexity to process T time slots with M task types?
    options:
      - O(T * M)
      - O(T log M)
      - O(M log T)
      - O(T + M)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: In each of the T slots, we perform heap/queue operations which are proportional to O(log M).
