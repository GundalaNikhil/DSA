    question: With n=3 and m=2 (binary merge), and frequencies [5, 7, 10], what is the first merge cost?
    options:
      - "5"
      - "10"
      - "12"
      - "15"
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Merge 5 and 7 (two smallest) -> cost 12.

    question: Why is it necessary to pad the frequencies with zeros when m > 2?
    options:
      - To make the heap size even
      - To ensure that every merge operation actually merges exactly 'm' nodes
      - To reduce the total cost
      - To handle duplicate frequencies
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Padding ensure that we don't end up with a final merge of fewer than 'm' nodes, which would be sub-optimal if the condition (n-1)%(m-1)==0 isn't met.

    question: Which data structure is essential for the greedy strategy of merging smallest frequencies?
    options:
      - Max-heap
      - Min-heap
      - Stack
      - Hash Map
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A min-heap allows efficient retrieval of the smallest 'm' values in O(m log N) time.

    question: What is the time complexity of building the M-ary Huffman tree?
    options:
      - O(N)
      - O(N log N)
      - O(N * M)
      - O(N^2)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Each node is added to the heap once and merged. Heap operations take O(log N), and there are roughly N/M merges.
