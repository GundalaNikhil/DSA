**Question Name:** Ride Share Fare Calculator
**Slug:** ride-share-fare-calculator
**Title:** Max Consecutive Ones III
**Difficulty:** Medium
**Premium:** No
**Tags:** Sliding Window, Array, Two Pointers

## Problem Description

You are given a binary array representing driver availability over time slots (1 = available, 0 = unavailable) and an integer K representing the number of unavailable time slots you can convert to available through incentives. Find the maximum number of consecutive available time slots you can achieve.

## A Simple Scenario (Daily Life Usage)

Imagine you're an Uber dispatcher managing driver availability. Each hour is marked as 1 (driver available) or 0 (driver unavailable). You can offer incentives to K drivers to make them available during their off-hours. For example, with availability [1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1] and K=2 incentives, you can flip two 0s to get the longest consecutive availability period.

## Your Task

Write a function that takes a binary array and K, and returns the maximum number of consecutive 1s you can get by flipping at most K zeros to ones.

## Why is it Important?

This problem teaches you:

- Sliding window with flip/transformation constraint
- Optimizing resource allocation
- Real-world logistics and scheduling
- Maximizing service availability

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:** `availability = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0]`, `k = 2`
**Output:** `6`
**Explanation:** Flip the two 0s at indices 9 and 10. The longest sequence of 1s is from index 4 to 10, with length 6.
Actually: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1] -> indices 5-10 gives us 6 consecutive 1s.

### Example 2:

**Input:** `availability = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]`, `k = 3`
**Output:** `10`
**Explanation:** Flip the 0s at indices 8, 9, and 10 to get 10 consecutive 1s.

### Example 3:

**Input:** `availability = [0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0]`, `k = 0`
**Output:** `3`
**Explanation:** Without any flips, the longest sequence is [1,1,1] with length 3.

### Example 4:

**Input:** `availability = [1,1,1,1]`, `k = 0`
**Output:** `4`
**Explanation:** All drivers are already available.

## Constraints

- 1 <= availability.length <= 10^5
- availability[i] is either 0 or 1
- 0 <= k <= availability.length
- Binary array represents time slot availability
