questions:
  - question: How is the score for a value v computed at time now?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Count of occurrences
      - Sum of exp(-(now - t) / D) over all timestamps t for v
      - Average of timestamps
      - Max timestamp
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Each occurrence contributes an exponential decay term based on recency.

  - question: Why do we need a hash map in the solution?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - To sort timestamps
      - To accumulate scores per distinct value
      - To remove duplicates from the input
      - To store a fixed-size window
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Scores are aggregated per value, so we need to sum contributions by key.
