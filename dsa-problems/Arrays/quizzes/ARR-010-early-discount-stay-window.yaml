  - question: How is profit computed for a buy at i and sell at j?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - prices[j] - prices[i]
      - min(prices[j], C) - prices[i]
      - prices[i] - prices[j]
      - max(prices[j], C) - prices[i]
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The selling price is capped at C, while the buy price is not capped.

  - question: For a fixed sell day j, which buy indices are valid?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - i in [0, j - dMin]
      - i in [j - dMax, j - dMin]
      - i in [j + dMin, j + dMax]
      - i in [0, n-1]
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The holding period must satisfy dMin <= j - i <= dMax.

  - question: For prices = [7, 2, 5, 1, 9], dMin=1, dMax=3, C=6, what is the maximum profit?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "3"
      - "4"
      - "5"
      - "7"

  - question: What data structure supports tracking the minimum buy price in the sliding window efficiently?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Stack
      - Monotonic deque
      - Binary search tree
      - Hash set
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A monotonic deque maintains candidates for the minimum in amortized O(1).
