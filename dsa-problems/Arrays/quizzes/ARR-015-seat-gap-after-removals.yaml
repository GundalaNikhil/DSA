  - question: "Removal indices refer to:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Seat position values
      - Indices in the original array
      - Indices after each removal
      - Only the last two seats
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The input indices are based on the original array positions.

  - question: For seats = [2, 5, 9, 10] and remove index 1, what is the maximum gap?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "4"
      - "5"
      - "7"
      - "8"
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Remaining seats are [2, 9, 10], so max gap is 9-2 = 7.

  - question: Which approach avoids O(n^2) removals?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Remove elements from a list one by one
      - Use a boolean removed array and scan once
      - Sort the indices and re-run sort
      - Use recursion
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Marking removals and scanning once is linear.

  - question: What is the time complexity of the optimal solution?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(n)
      - O(n log n)
      - O(n^2)
      - O(r log n)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Marking and scanning both take linear time.
