  - question: Given all arr[i] are positive, what is the best choice regarding the optional drop?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Always drop the largest element
      - Always drop the smallest element
      - Never drop, because dropping reduces the sum
      - Drop when k is even
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: With positive numbers, removing any element decreases the window sum.
