questions:
  - question: What is the key extra constraint on the pair?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Values must be distinct
      - Indices must not be in the forbidden set
      - Both values must be even
      - Indices must be adjacent
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A valid pair cannot use any forbidden index.

  - question: For arr = [1, 4, 6, 7], target=11, forbidden indices {0}, what is the answer?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "true"
      - "false"
      - depends on sorting
      - not enough data
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Indices 1 and 3 are allowed, and 4 + 7 = 11.

  - question: When a pointer lands on a forbidden index, what should the algorithm do?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Use the value anyway
      - Move the pointer past forbidden indices before checking sums
      - Restart from the beginning
      - Sort the array again
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Forbidden indices must be skipped before evaluating the pair sum.

  - question: What is the time complexity of the two-pointer solution with a hash set for forbidden indices?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(n)
      - O(n log n)
      - O(n^2)
      - O(log n)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Each pointer advances at most n times; forbidden checks are O(1).
