  - question: What is rotated in this problem?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - The entire array
      - Only the elements at blackout indices
      - Only the elements at non-blackout indices, preserving their order
      - Only the first k elements
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Blackout indices stay fixed; the remaining elements rotate among themselves.

  - question: For arr = [10, 20, 30, 40], k=1, blackout indices {2}, what is the output?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - 10 20 30 40
      - 20 40 30 10
      - 40 10 30 20
      - 20 10 30 40
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Movable values [10,20,40] rotate left by 1 to [20,40,10], placed back at indices 0,1,3.

  - question: What should you do with k before rotating the movable elements?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Use k directly
      - Use k % n
      - Use k % movable_count
      - Ignore k if there is any blackout index
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Only the movable elements rotate, so reduce k by the number of movable elements.

  - question: If all indices are blacked out, what is the result?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - The array is unchanged
      - The array is fully reversed
      - The array becomes all zeros
      - Only index 0 changes
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: With zero movable indices, there is nothing to rotate.
