  - question: Why can we process all add queries first before answering sums?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Because sums are never requested
      - Because all add queries appear before sum queries
      - Because adds commute with sums only if array is sorted
      - Because we must sort the queries
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The input guarantees all add operations occur before any sum queries.

  - question: In a difference array, how do you apply add l r x?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - diff[l] -= x and diff[r] += x
      - diff[l] += x and diff[r+1] -= x
      - diff[l+1] += x and diff[r] -= x
      - diff[l] += x and diff[r] += x
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Adding at l starts the increase; subtracting at r+1 stops it.

  - question: After applying all adds, how do you answer sum l r quickly?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Recompute the array for each query
      - "Use a prefix sum array: sum = P[r+1] - P[l]"
      - Use binary search on the array
      - Sort the array and take a range
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Prefix sums allow O(1) range sum queries.

  - question: Which data type is safest for storing final sums?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - 32-bit int
      - 64-bit long
      - 8-bit byte
      - Boolean
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Values and sums can exceed 32-bit limits.
