    type: single_choice
    question: "What is the time complexity advantage of using prefix sum over recalculating from scratch?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Improves from O(n²) to O(n)"

      - option_id: "C"
        text: "No improvement in time complexity"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Improves from O(n) to O(log n)"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Without prefix sum, calculating n averages requires O(n²) operations. With prefix sum, it becomes O(n)."

    question: "Why should you use 'long' instead of 'int' for the running sum variable in Java?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "For better performance"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"

        correct: false
    explanation: "With large arrays and values up to 10^9, the cumulative sum can exceed int's maximum value (2^31-1), causing overflow. Using 'long' prevents this issue."
