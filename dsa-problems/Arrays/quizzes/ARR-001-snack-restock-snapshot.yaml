  - question: For input n=4 and arr = [4, 6, 6, 0], what output should be printed?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - 4 6 6 0
      - 4 5 5 4
      - 5 5 4 4
      - 4 5 6 4
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Running sums are 4, 10, 16, 16; divide by 1..4 and floor gives 4 5 5 4.

  - question: How is the prefix average at index i computed?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - floor((arr[i-1] + arr[i]) / 2)
      - floor(sum(arr[0..i]) / (i + 1))
      - ceil(sum(arr[0..i]) / n)
      - sum(arr[0..i]) - i
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The prefix average uses the sum from index 0 to i divided by i+1, floored.

  - question: Why should the running sum use 64-bit arithmetic?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - The sum can exceed 32-bit limits
      - Division only works on 64-bit types
      - Arrays require 64-bit indices
      - The averages are always fractional
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: With n up to 100000 and values up to 1000000, the sum can exceed 2^31-1.

  - question: What is the time complexity of the optimal solution?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(n)
      - O(n log n)
      - O(n^2)
      - O(1)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We compute a running sum and one average per index in a single pass.
