questions:
  - question: Which indices are valid to smooth?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Only index 0
      - Only index n-1
      - Any index i where 1 <= i <= n-2
      - Only even indices
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: The smoothing formula needs i-1 and i+1, so i must be between 1 and n-2.

  - question: What is the smoothed value at index i?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - ceil((a[i-1] + a[i] + a[i+1]) / 3)
      - floor((a[i-1] + a[i] + a[i+1]) / 3)
      - (a[i-1] + a[i+1]) / 2
      - a[i]
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The problem specifies floor of the average of a[i-1], a[i], and a[i+1].

  - question: For arr = [-2, 3, -4, 5], what is the maximum subarray sum after optimal smoothing?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - "5"
      - "7"
      - "9"
      - "10"
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Smoothing index 2 gives [-2, 3, 1, 5], whose max subarray sum is 9.

  - question: When evaluating a smoothing position i, which candidates must be considered for the best subarray?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Only subarrays that include index i
      - Only the maximum subarray on the left
      - Only the maximum subarray on the right
      - The best crossing subarray through i and the best subarrays entirely on either side
    correct_answer: 3
    explanation: The optimal subarray might cross i or be entirely on one side.
