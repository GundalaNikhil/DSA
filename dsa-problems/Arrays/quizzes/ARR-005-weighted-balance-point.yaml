  - question: Which elements are included in the left and right sums for index i?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "Left: arr[0..i], Right: arr[i..n-1]"
      - "Left: arr[0..i-1], Right: arr[i+1..n-1]"
      - "Left: arr[0..i-1], Right: arr[i..n-1]"
      - "Left: arr[0..i], Right: arr[i+1..n-1]"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The pivot at i is excluded from both sides.

  - question: For arr = [2, 3, -1, 3, 2], L=2, R=1, what index satisfies the condition?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "1"
      - "2"
      - "3"
      - "4"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: At i=2, left sum = 5, right sum = 8, and 5*2 == 8*1.

  - question: How do you compute right_sum in O(1) while scanning?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - right_sum = total_sum - left_sum - arr[i]
      - right_sum = total_sum - left_sum
      - right_sum = left_sum - total_sum
      - right_sum = arr[i] - total_sum
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Total sum minus left sum and the pivot gives the right sum.

    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - The largest index
      - Any index
      - The smallest index
      - The middle index
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: The problem asks for the smallest valid index.
