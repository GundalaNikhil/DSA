  - question: What shape must the final height profile satisfy?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Strictly increasing
      - Non-decreasing up to a peak, then non-increasing
      - Alternating high-low pattern
      - Strictly decreasing
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The profile must be unimodal with a single peak.

  - question: Which precomputations are used in the optimal solution?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Prefix max L[i] and suffix max R[i] with their cumulative sums
      - Prefix min and suffix min
      - Only a global max
      - Sorting the array
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: L and R capture minimal feasible heights for non-decreasing and non-increasing sides.
