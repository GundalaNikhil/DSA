  - question: "In the optimal approach, moving a non-zero to the current write position counts as:"
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - One swap, even if it skips multiple zeros
      - A swap for every zero it passes
      - Zero swaps because it is a write
      - Only swaps when the element is negative
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The intended model counts a direct swap between a non-zero and a zero as 1.
