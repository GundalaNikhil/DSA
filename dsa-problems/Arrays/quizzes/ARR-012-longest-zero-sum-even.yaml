    options:
      - "2"
      - "3"
      - "4"
      - "5"
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Subarray [0..3] has sum 0 and length 4.

  - question: Why is parity tracking needed in the prefix-sum map?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - To ensure the sum is positive
      - Because even length requires the same parity for prefix indices
      - Because values are even
      - Because arrays are 1-indexed
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Even length means the two prefix indices have the same parity.

  - question: What is the correct base initialization for sum 0?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Sum 0 first seen at index 0 (even)
      - Sum 0 first seen at index -1 (odd)
      - Sum 0 first seen at index n-1
      - No base case is needed
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Index -1 represents an empty prefix and has odd parity.
