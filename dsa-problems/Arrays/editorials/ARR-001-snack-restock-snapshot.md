# ARR-001: Snack Restock Snapshot

## 📋 Problem Summary

Given an array representing daily inventory values, compute the prefix average (rounded down) for each position.

## 🌍 Real-World Scenario

**Scenario Title:** Campus Snack Shop Manager

Imagine you manage a college snack shop. Every evening, you count the inventory:

- Day 1: 4 items
- Day 2: 6 items
- Day 3: 6 items
- Day 4: 0 items (forgot to restock!)

Your boss asks: "What's been the **average inventory** from opening day until each day?"

This is exactly what prefix averages solve! It helps identify trends:

- Is inventory improving or declining?
- Do we need to order more frequently?
- Are we maintaining sufficient stock?

**Why This Problem Matters:**

- **Data Analysis**: Prefix averages smooth out daily fluctuations to show long-term trends.
- **Resource Planning**: Helps in deciding when to restock based on average consumption.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Used in systems to track average response times over a session.

## ✅ Input/Output Clarifications (Read This Before Coding)

- **Rounding**: You must use **floor** division (integer division). `7 / 2 = 3`, not `3.5`.
- **Data Types**: The sum of elements can grow large. Even if individual elements fit in `int`, the sum might overflow `int`. Use `long` (Java/C++) or Python's arbitrary precision integers.
- **Constraints**: `n` up to 100,000 means an O(n^2) solution will time out. You need O(n).

Common interpretation mistake:

- ❌ Calculating the average of the *current* window of size k.
- ✅ Calculating the average of *everything* from index 0 to current index i.

### Core Concept: Running Sum

The fundamental approach is to maintain a cumulative sum as we iterate through the array. This avoids re-adding elements we've already seen.

### Why Naive Approach is too slow

Recalculating the sum from index 0 every single time involves a nested loop structure.
- Summing `i` elements takes `i` steps.
- Doing this for `n` elements takes `1 + 2 + ... + n` steps.
This is O(n^2). For n = 100,000, n^2 = 10,000,000,000 operations, which far exceeds the typical 10^8 operations per second limit.

## Naive Approach

### Intuition

For each day `i`, just loop from the start (day 0) to day `i`, sum up the numbers, and divide by `i + 1`.

### Algorithm

1. Loop `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
2. Inside, initialize `current_sum = 0`.
3. Loop `j` from 0 to `i`.
4. Add `arr[j]` to `current_sum`.
5. Calculate average and store it.

### Time Complexity

- **O(n²)**: The nested loops sum up to n(n+1)/2 operations.

### Space Complexity

- **O(1)**: No extra space used besides the input and output.

### Why This Works

It correctly implements the definition of prefix average by summing from scratch each time.

### Limitations

- **Too Slow**: Will Time Limit Exceed (TLE) for large inputs (n > 5000).

## Optimal Approach

### Key Insight

Notice that `Sum(0 to i) = Sum(0 to i-1) + arr[i]`.
We don't need to sum from 0 again! We can just add the new element to the sum we already have.

### Algorithm

1. Initialize `running_sum = 0`.
2. Create an empty `result` array.
3. Iterate `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
4. Update `running_sum += arr[i]`.
5. Calculate `average = running_sum / (i + 1)` (using integer division).
6. Append `average` to `result`.

### Time Complexity

- **O(n)**: We perform constant time operations (addition, division) for each of the `n` elements.

### Space Complexity

- **O(1)**: We only store `running_sum`, which takes constant extra space (ignoring the output array).

### Why This Is Optimal

We touch every element exactly once. It's impossible to do better than O(n) because we must read the input and write the output.

## Implementations

### Java


### Python


### C++


### JavaScript


## 🧪 Test Case Walkthrough (Dry Run)

Use the sample:

- Input: `[4, 6, 6, 0]`
- n = 4

We maintain:

- `runningSum`: holds sum of elements seen so far
- `result`: array to store averages

Initialize:

- `runningSum = 0`
- `result = []`

Now iterate:

| Step (i) | Value (`arr[i]`) | Running Sum (`prev + val`) | Calculation | Stored |
| ---: | :----: | -----: | ----------- | -----: |
|    0 | 4  |  0 + 4 = 4 | 4 / 1 = 4 | 4 |
|    1 | 6  |  4 + 6 = 10 | 10 / 2 = 5 | 5 |
|    2 | 6  |  10 + 6 = 16 | 16 / 3 = 5.33.. | 5 |
|    3 | 0  |  16 + 0 = 16 | 16 / 4 = 4 | 4 |

Answer is `[4, 5, 5, 4]`.

## ✅ Proof of Correctness

### Invariant

At the end of iteration `i`, `runningSum` correctly contains the sum of `arr[0]...arr[i]`.

### Why the approach is correct

Base case: At `i=0`, `runningSum` adds `arr[0]`, which is correct.
Inductive step: Assume `runningSum` is correct for `i-1`. In step `i`, we add `arr[i]`. Thus `runningSum` becomes sum of `0...i-1` plus `arr[i]`, which is exactly sum of `0...i`.
The division `runningSum / (i+1)` therefore correctly computes the average of the first `i+1` elements.

## 💡 Interview Extensions (High-Value Add-ons)

- **Streaming Input:** How would you handle it if numbers come one by one and you need to print the average immediately? (A: Same approach, maintain sum and count).
- **Floating Point:** What if we needed precise averages? (A: Use double/float, be careful of precision).
- **Sliding Window:** What if we need average of *last k* elements? (A: Use sliding window approach, maintain sum of last k).

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Integer Overflow**
   - ❌ Using `int` for sum when `n * max_val` exceeds 2^31-1.
   - ✅ Use `long` (Java/C++) or Python.

2. **Division Type**
   - ❌ Using floating point division or not flooring results.
   - ✅ Use integer division (`//` in Python, `/` in Java/C++ for integers).

3. **Off-by-One Error**
   - ❌ Dividing by `i` instead of `i+1`.
   - ✅ Remember indices are 0-based, count is `i+1`.

4. **Recalculating Sum**
   - ❌ Summing from 0 every time (O(n^2)).
   - ✅ Maintaining a running sum (O(n)).

5. **Wrong Output Format**
   - ❌ Printing floating point numbers.
   - ✅ Printing integers.
