  - question: Which hours should be utilized first to minimize the total cost?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - All available standard hours (Cost 0)
      - Overtime hours with the lowest rate
      - Hours from the shift with the longest standard duration
      - Hours from the shift with the highest overtime rate
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Standard hours are essentially 'free' or sunk costs. To minimize additional spending, you must exhaust all standard hours before paying for any overtime.

  - question: How should the remaining required hours be covered after standard hours are exhausted?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - By using overtime from the single shift with the absolute minimum overtime rate
      - By distributing them evenly across all shifts
      - By using overtime from the shift with the most standard hours
      - By using the rate closest to the average
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Since there is no limit on overtime per shift, strictly assigning all excess hours to the cheapest rate yields the lowest cost.

  - question: What is the appropriate data type for storing `H` and the total cost?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 10
    options:
      - 64-bit integer (long / long long)
      - 32-bit integer (int)
      - Floating point (float)
      - Short integer
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: With `H` up to 10^12, a 32-bit integer (max ~2*10^9) will overflow. A 64-bit integer is required.

  - question: What is the time complexity to find the optimal solution if we just scan for the minimum rate?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(N)
      - O(N log N)
      - O(N^2)
      - O(log N)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We iterate through the list once to sum standard hours and find the minimum overtime rate, taking linear time O(N).
