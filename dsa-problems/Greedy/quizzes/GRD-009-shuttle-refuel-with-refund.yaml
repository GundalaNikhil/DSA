questions:
  - question: To maximize the chance of completing the circular route, which segment should ideally be refunded?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - The segment with the maximum cost in the entire circuit
      - The segment where the fuel tank drops below zero
      - The first segment of the route
      - The segment with the minimum gain
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Refunding the maximum cost edge adds the largest possible amount to your total fuel balance (`totalGain - totalCost`), maximizing the 'safety margin' for the entire trip.

  - question: After applying the coupon to the optimal edge, the problem reduces to which classic algorithm?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 10
    options:
      - Gas Station (Circular Tour) problem
      - Longest Path in a DAG
      - Knapsack Problem
      - Traveling Salesman Problem
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "Once one cost is set to 0, it becomes the standard Gas Station problem: finding a starting point in a circular route where `totalGain >= totalCost`."

  - question: Is it possible for the total fuel balance to be positive (`totalGain >= totalCost`) but still have no valid starting point?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - No, if `totalGain >= totalCost`, a valid start always exists
      - Yes, if the gains are distributed unevenly
      - Yes, if the route is too long
      - No, but only if the graph is a tree
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: A key property of the Gas Station problem is that if the total net resource is non-negative, there exists at least one valid starting point.

  - question: What is the time complexity of the optimal solution?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(N)
      - O(N log N)
      - O(N^2)
      - O(1)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We need one pass to find the max cost and another pass (Greedy Scan) to find the start index, resulting in linear O(N) complexity.
