questions:
  - question: How many switches are counted for the very first trip assignment?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "0"
      - "1"
      - Depends on which driver is chosen
      - "-1"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The first assignment establishes the current driver; a switch only occurs when the driver changes between consecutive trips.

  - question: What is the time complexity of the optimal solution?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(N)
      - O(N log N)
      - O(N^2)
      - O(2^N)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We iterate through the trips exactly once (O(N)), maintaining constant state for the minimum switches ending with Driver A or B.

  - question: In the DP/Greedy approach, what do the state variables `costA` and `costB` represent?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Minimum switches required to cover all trips up to the current one, ending with Driver A and Driver B respectively
      - The total salary cost for Driver A and Driver B
      - The number of trips assigned to Driver A and Driver B so far
      - The remaining available time for Driver A and Driver B
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: These variables track the optimal cost (min switches) to reach the current valid state, ending with a specific driver.

  - question: What is the correct return value if a specific trip cannot be covered by either driver?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "-1"
      - Infinity
      - "0"
      - The count of switches up to that point
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: If any trip cannot be covered (neither driver is available), the schedule is invalid, and -1 must be returned.
