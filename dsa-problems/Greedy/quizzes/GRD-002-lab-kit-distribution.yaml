questions:
  - question: Which data structure is most suitable for efficiently retrieving and updating the largest available kit quantity?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Max-Heap (Priority Queue)
      - Sorted Array
      - Stack
      - Hash Map
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We constantly need to access and decrement the maximum element. A Max-Heap allows extraction and re-insertion in O(log k) time.

  - question: Why is sorting the array of quantities only once at the beginning insufficient?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Decrementing a value changes its relative order, effectively invalidating the sort
      - The initial sort takes too long
      - Sorting works, but it's harder to implement
      - The values don't change enough to matter
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: After taking a kit from the largest pile, that pile might become smaller than others. To maintain the greedy property, we need dynamic re-ordering (or a heap).

  - question: What is the time complexity of the optimal Max-Heap solution?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(m log k)
      - O(m * k)
      - O(k log k)
      - O(1)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We perform `m` distribution steps. In each step, we extract from and potentially insert into a heap of size `k`, taking O(log k).

  - question: How is the number of 'zeroed types' calculated in the optimal approach?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Total types (k) minus the number of types remaining in the heap
      - The current size of the heap
      - The number of students left unserved
      - The sum of remaining kits
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Types are removed from the heap only when they reach 0. Therefore, the difference between the initial count `k` and the final heap size is the number of zeroed types.
