questions:
  - question: Which algorithmic technique is most suitable for efficiently finding the maximum interval overlap?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Sweep Line Algorithm
      - Brute Force
      - Dynamic Programming
      - Depth First Search
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The Sweep Line algorithm processes start and end events in order, efficiently tracking the number of active intervals at any point.

  - question: When sorting events, how should ties (same time) be handled to correctly calculate peak overlap for inclusive intervals?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 10
    options:
      - Process Start (+1) before End (-1)
      - Process End (-1) before Start (+1)
      - The order doesn't matter
      - Process them randomly
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: If an exam ends at T and another starts at T, processing the Start first ensures we count both as active at instant T, capturing the true peak demand.

  - question: If the maximum overlap is `maxOverlap` and each proctor handles `r` exams, how many proctors are needed?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "`ceil(maxOverlap / r)`"
      - "`floor(maxOverlap / r)`"
      - "`maxOverlap * r`"
      - "`maxOverlap - r`"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We need enough proctors to cover the peak load. Integer ceiling division `(max + r - 1) / r` gives the correct count.

  - question: What is the primary factor determining the time complexity of the Sweep Line approach?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "Sorting the start and end events: O(N log N)"
      - "Iterating through the timeline: O(MAX_TIME)"
      - "The number of proctors: O(r)"
      - "Space complexity: O(N^2)"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The algorithm creates 2N events and sorts them, which dominates the runtime. The sweep itself is linear O(N).
