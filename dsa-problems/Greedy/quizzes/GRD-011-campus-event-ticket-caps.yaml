questions:
  - question: Why do we sort the requests by deadline instead of by quantity (value)?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Processing by deadline allows us to satisfy urgent tasks while giving us the option to replace low-value urgent tasks with high-value later tasks.
      - Sorting by quantity would always result in missing early deadlines.
      - Sorting by deadline guarantees O(N) complexity.
      - It doesn't matter; both sorting strategies work.
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Sorting by deadline provides the structure to ensure feasibility. A min-heap then allows us to greedy keep the highest values seen 'so far' within the deadline constraints.

  - question: What is the role of the Min-Heap in the optimal solution?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - It stores the quantities of selected requests, allowing us to efficiently discard the least valuable request when time runs out.
      - It stores the deadlines to efficiently find the next available day.
      - It stores the requests sorted by deadline.
      - It is used to merge overlapping intervals.

    explanation: The min-heap holds the values of the currently 'accepted' set. If the set grows too large for the current deadline, identifying and removing the minimum value (min-heap root) maximizes the sum of the remaining values.

  - question: When do we remove an element from the heap?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - When the heap size exceeds the current request's deadline.
      - When the heap size exceeds N.
      - When the current request value is less than the heap minimum.
      - Never, we only add to the heap.
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Since processing takes 1 unit of time, `deadline` equals the maximum capacity of tasks we can do by that time. If `count > deadline`, we must drop one.

  - question: What is the overall time complexity of the solution?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(N log N)
      - O(N^2)
      - O(N)
      - O(log N)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We sort the requests (O(N log N)) and then perform N heap push/pop operations (also O(N log N)).
