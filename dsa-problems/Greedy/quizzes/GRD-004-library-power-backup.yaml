questions:
  - question: If the optimal solution requires using `k` batteries to meet the power requirement `T`, how many swaps are performed?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - k - 1
      - k
      - k + 1
      - "0"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The first battery is an initial setup. Each subsequent battery requires a switch. So, `swaps = count - 1`.

  - question: To minimize the number of swaps (and thus batteries used), how should the batteries be selected?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Largest capacity first (Sort Descending)
      - Smallest capacity first (Sort Ascending)
      - Randomly
      - Based on battery weight
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Greedily choosing the largest available batteries maximizes the coverage per battery, minimizing the total number of batteries needed to reach sum >= T.

  - question: Why would using a standard 32-bit integer for the `currentSum` variable be risky in this problem?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 10
    options:
      - The total capacity can reach ~10^14, exceeding the 32-bit limit (~2*10^9)
      - The number of batteries `n` is too large
      - The time `T` can be negative
      - Swaps can be negative
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: With `n` up to 10^5 and each capacity up to 10^9, the sum can be 10^14, requiring a 64-bit integer (long/long long).

  - question: If the goal was to minimize the *total capacity used* to satisfy at least `T` (instead of minimizing swaps), what would be the strategy?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Sort Ascending (use smallest sufficient batteries)
      - Sort Descending (largest first)
      - Use Dynamic Programming
      - Always pick the median capacity
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: To meet the threshold `T` with minimal excess, picking smaller batteries allows for finer granularity, reducing 'waste' over `T`.
