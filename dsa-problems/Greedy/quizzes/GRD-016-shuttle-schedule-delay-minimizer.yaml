questions:
  - question: To minimize the total accumulated delay, how should the trips be sorted?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - By their 'planned finish time' (`start_time + duration`) in ascending order (Earliest Due Date).
      - By their duration in ascending order (Shortest Job First).
      - By their planned start time in ascending order.
      - By their duration in descending order.
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Sorting by `s[i] + d[i]` (Planned Finish Time) effectively prioritizes tasks that become 'urgent' soonest, minimizing the cascading delay effect.

  - question: If a trip starts BEFORE its planned start time, what is the delay?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 10
    options:
      - 0 (Early starts incur no penalty).
      - Negative delay (bonus).
      - Absolute difference between planned and actual start.
      - It is impossible to start early.
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The problem defines delay as `max(0, actual_start - planned_start)`. Starting early is allowed and carries no penalty.

  - question: What is the time complexity of the optimal solution?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(N log N)
      - O(N^2)
      - O(N)
      - O(N!)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The solution relies on sorting the trips, which takes O(N log N), followed by a linear O(N) pass to calculate delays.

  - question: Does the optimal order depend on the current time?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - No, the static sorted order (Earliest Due Date) is sufficient regardless of start time.
      - Yes, we must re-evaluate after every task.
      - Yes, but only if delays become negative.
      - No, because delays are always zero.
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The EDD rule provides a static ordering that remains optimal for this specific single-machine scheduling problem minimizing total tardiness/delay.
