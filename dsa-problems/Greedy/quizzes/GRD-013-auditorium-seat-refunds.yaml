  - question: The problem asks to minimize the highest occupied row. What is the optimal strategy to achieve this?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Consolidate all remaining attendees into the lowest possible rows (1, 2, ...).
      - Keep everyone in their original seats.
      - Move everyone to the highest possible rows.
      - Spread attendees evenly across all rows.
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Since people can be moved to fill vacancies, the best way to empty high rows is to pack everyone into the bottom-most rows.

  - question: Does the specific location of a refund request affect the final answer?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 10
    options:
      - No, only the total number of refunds matters.
      - Yes, because we can only move people from the same row.
      - Yes, refunds in higher rows are more valuable.
      - It depends on the row capacity.
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Because we can move any person to fill any vacancy in a lower row, the specific seat doesn't matter, only the total count of remaining people.

  - question: How do we calculate the highest occupied row efficiently?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Calculate total remaining people, then simulate filling rows from 1 upwards until we run out of people.
      - Simulate each refund and move operations one by one.
      - Sort the rows by capacity and fill largest first.
      - Refunds cannot change row occupancy.
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: This 'water filling' approach (filling capacity from bottom up) correctly determines the level the 'people sediment' reaches.

  - question: What is the time complexity of the optimal solution?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(R), where R is the number of rows.
      - O(N log N), where N is refunds.
      - O(N * R)
      - O(Total Capacity)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We simply sum capacities and then iterate through the rows once to distribute the remaining people, taking linear time relative to the number of rows.
