questions:
  - question: This problem is a constrained variation of which classic algorithm?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Merge K Sorted Lists
      - Merge Sort
      - Longest Increasing Subsequence
      - Topological Sort
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The core task is merging `k` sorted queues, which is solved using a Min-Heap, similar to the classic 'Merge K Sorted Lists' problem, but with an added constraint on consecutive values.

  - question: What happens if the smallest available value in the heap would create a 3rd consecutive duplicate in the output?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 10
    options:
      - It is temporarily skipped; the next smallest valid value is used instead
      - The process terminates immediately
      - The value is discarded permanently
      - The constraint is ignored to preserve sorting
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: To satisfy the constraint while maintaining sorted order as much as possible, we skip the blocking value, use the next best valid option, and then reconsider the skipped value.

  - question: What should happen if ALL currently available values in the heap are blocked (i.e., they are all equal to the last output value)?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 10
    options:
      - The merging process must stop (deadlock)
      - We pick any value at random
      - We wait for more queues to be added
      - We remove the last element from the output
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: If every available queue head is the same as the value we are forbidden from picking, we cannot proceed further validly, so the process terminates.

  - question: What is the time complexity of this approach?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(N log k)
      - O(N^2)
      - O(k log N)
      - O(N)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We process each of the N elements, and each operation involves heap insertions/deletions which take O(log k).
