questions:
  - question: To ensure the quality threshold `T` is maintained as long as possible, which parts should be merged first?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - The two parts with the highest quality scores
      - The two parts with the lowest weights
      - The two parts with the lowest quality scores
      - The two parts with the highest weights
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Merging highest quality parts maximizes the resulting quality (`min(q1, q2) - 1`), providing the best buffer against the threshold `T`.

  - question: What happens if the calculated quality of a potential bundle is less than `T`?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - The task is impossible, return -1 (assuming optimal geometric strategy)
      - We skip this pair and try another
      - We set the quality to T and continue
      - We merge them anyway but mark it as invalid
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: If the 'greedy for quality' strategy fails to meet `T` with the best available parts, no other combination can satisfy it, so it's impossible.

  - question: How is the 10% material loss calculated during a merge?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 10
    options:
      - "`floor(0.1 * min(w1, w2))`"
      - "`floor(0.1 * (w1 + w2))`"
      - "`ceil(0.1 * max(w1, w2))`"
      - "`0.1 * w1` regardless of size"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The loss is specifically 10% of the *smaller* part's weight, rounded down.

  - question: Why is a Huffman-coding style merge (smallest weights first) inappropriate here?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 10
    options:
      - It ignores the quality constraint, likely causing an early failure below `T`
      - It would maximize weight too much
      - Huffman coding only works for compression
      - It is actually the correct approach
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Prioritizing weight (like Huffman) might merge low-quality parts early, causing the quality to drop below `T` prematurely.
