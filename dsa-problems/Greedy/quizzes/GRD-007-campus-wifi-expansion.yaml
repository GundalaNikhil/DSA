questions:
  - question: This problem is a variation of which classic graph algorithm?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
      - Shortest Path (Dijkstra)
      - Topological Sort
      - Maximum Flow
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We need to connect all nodes with minimum total edge weight, which is the definition of the Minimum Spanning Tree problem.

  - question: To avoid processing O(N^2) edges, which edges are sufficient to consider to guarantee the MST?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Edges between adjacent buildings after sorting by height
      - Edges between the first building and all others
      - Edges with cost less than 100
      - Edges between even and odd indexed buildings
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: In a 1D line metric, the MST edge set is always a subset of the edges connecting immediate neighbors in the sorted order.

  - question: How should existing 'free' cables be handled?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 10
    options:
      - Add them to the Union-Find structure first (or as cost 0 edges)
      - Ignore them and rebuild everything
      - Treat them as edges with infinite cost
      - Subtract their length from the final answer
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Existing connections are free, so union connected components immediately to reduce the number of new edges needed.

  - question: What is the time complexity of the optimized solution?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(N log N)
      - O(N^2)
      - O(N!)
      - O(N)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Sorting the buildings takes O(N log N). Processing the ~N candidate edges with Union-Find takes nearly linear time.
