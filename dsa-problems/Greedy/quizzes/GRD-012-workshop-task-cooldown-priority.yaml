questions:
  - question: How does executing a high-priority task affect lower-priority tasks currently in cooldown?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - It resets their cooldown, forcing them to wait an additional k slots from the current time.
      - It has no effect; they continue cooling down as normal.
      - It cancels their cooldown immediately, making them ready next slot.
      - It moves them back to the ready queue immediately.
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The 'Priority Interrupt' rule states that high-priority execution disrupts the environment, resetting safety timers (cooldowns) for all lower-priority tasks.

  - question: Ideally, which task should be chosen from the Ready Queue to minimize total time?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 10
    options:
      - Highest Priority first, then Highest Remaining Count.
      - Lowest Priority first, to avoid interrupts.
      - Task with the smallest remaining count.
      - Task that has been waiting the longest.
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Greedy strategy prioritizes the most urgent constraint (Priority). Using high-count tasks early is secondary to ensure we don't end up with a long chain of idle slots at the end.

  - question: Do interrupts affect tasks that are currently valid in the Ready Queue?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - No, interrupts only penalize tasks that are currently waiting in the cooldown phase.
      - Yes, all lower priority tasks are delayed regardless of state.
      - Yes, but only if they have the same task name.
      - No, interrupts only affect higher priority tasks.
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Only tasks that are 'cooling down' are sensitive to the disruption. Tasks already safe to execute (in Ready Queue) remain safe.

  - question: What is the primary factor in the Time Complexity of the simulation?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Total Time Slots * Number of Task Types (N)
      - N * log N
      - Total Tasks * k
      - k^2
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We simulate slot by slot. In each slot, we may scan the list of N task types (cooldown list) to apply interrupts, leading to O(Slots * N).
