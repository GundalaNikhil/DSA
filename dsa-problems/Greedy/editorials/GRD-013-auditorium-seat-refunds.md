# GRD-013: Auditorium Seat Refunds

## 📋 Problem Summary

You have an auditorium with `r` rows, each having a specific capacity. Initially, all seats are full. You receive `n` refund requests, each targeting a specific seat in a specific row. Your goal is to determine the **highest row number** that remains occupied (has at least one person) after processing all refunds.

## 🌍 Real-World Scenario

**Scenario Title:** Closing Down Sections of a Stadium

Imagine a stadium manager trying to save on cleaning costs.
- The stadium has sections numbered 1 to `R` (1 is closest to the field, `R` is the nosebleeds).
- Initially, the stadium is sold out.
- Before the game starts, many people cancel their tickets.
- If a section becomes completely empty, the manager can "close" it, turn off the lights, and send the security staff home for that section.
- The manager wants to know: What is the highest-numbered section that still has at least one fan? (Because they have to keep all sections up to that one open).

**Why This Problem Matters:**

- **Resource Deallocation:** Identifying when a resource group (row/server rack/cluster) becomes completely free so it can be shut down.
- **Sparse Data:** Tracking the "boundary" of active data in a large array.

## Detailed Explanation

### ASCII Diagram: The Rows

Rows: 1, 2, 3.
Capacities: [5, 4, 3].
Refunds: (3, 1), (3, 2), (2, 1).

**Initial State:**
Row 3: [X X X] (3 people)
Row 2: [X X X X] (4 people)
Row 1: [X X X X X] (5 people)
Highest Occupied: 3.

**Refund (3, 1):**
Row 3: [O X X] (2 people). Still occupied.
Highest: 3.

**Refund (3, 2):**
Row 3: [O O X] (1 person). Still occupied.
Highest: 3.

**Analysis of Example:**

The example initially seems confusing. The problem allows **consolidating** attendees by moving people from higher rows to fill vacancies in lower rows created by refunds.

Input:
- 3 rows with capacities: [5, 4, 3]
- 3 refunds from seats (3,1), (3,2), (2,1)

After refunds:
- Row 1: 5 people (full, no vacancies)
- Row 2: 3 people (1 vacancy)
- Row 3: 1 person (2 vacancies)

By moving the 1 person from Row 3 to the vacancy in Row 2, Row 3 becomes empty, giving output 2.

**Simplified Approach:**
The problem allows **consolidating** attendees into the lowest possible rows.

Key insight:
1. Calculate total remaining people after refunds: Total Capacity - Number of Refunds
2. Fill rows from bottom to top with remaining people
3. Find the highest row needed

For the example:
- Total capacity: 5 + 4 + 3 = 12
- Refunds: 3
- Remaining: 9
- Fill Row 1 (cap 5): 5 people
- Fill Row 2 (cap 4): 4 people
- Row 3: 0 people
- Highest occupied: 2

This matches the expected output.

The problem allows moving people from higher rows to lower rows to minimize the highest occupied row. Since we want to consolidate everyone into the lowest possible rows, the optimal strategy is to calculate total remaining people and fill rows from bottom to top.

## ✅ Input/Output Clarifications (Read This Before Coding)

- **Optimization:** You can move people from higher rows to fill empty seats in lower rows created by refunds.
- **Goal:** Empty the highest rows.
- **Input:** The refunds tell you exactly which seats become empty initially.

## Naive Approach

### Intuition

Simulate refunds. Then repeatedly find the highest occupied row and the lowest row with space, and move one person.

### Algorithm

1. `counts` array initialized to `capacities`.
2. Apply refunds: `counts[row]--`.
3. Loop:
   - Find largest `i` such that `counts[i] > 0`.
   - Find smallest `j` such that `counts[j] < capacities[j]`.
   - If `j < i`:
     - Move 1 person: `counts[i]--`, `counts[j]++`.
   - Else: Break.
4. Return max `i` with `counts[i] > 0`.

### Time Complexity

- **O(People * R)**: Moving one by one. Too slow if people count is high.

## Optimal Approach

### Key Insight

The optimal strategy is to consolidate all remaining people into the lowest possible rows. Since we can move people from higher rows to lower rows, we simply:

1. Calculate Total People Remaining = Total Capacity - Number of Refunds
2. Fill Row 1 up to its capacity
3. Fill Row 2 up to its capacity with any remaining people
4. Continue until all people are placed
5. Return the highest row that contains at least one person

This works because:
- Moving people from high to low rows is always allowed when there is space
- We want to minimize the highest occupied row
- The specific refund locations don't affect the final answer, only the total count matters
- Each row can hold up to its capacity, regardless of the initial distribution

### Algorithm

1. Calculate `Total_Capacity` (sum of all caps).
2. `Total_People = Total_Capacity - n` (where n is number of refunds).
3. Iterate `i` from 0 to `r-1`:
   - `Total_People -= capacities[i]`.
   - If `Total_People <= 0`:
     - Return `i + 1`.
4. Return `r`.

### Time Complexity

- **O(R)**: Linear scan of rows.
- **O(1)**: If we use prefix sums and binary search (but `R=10^5` is small enough for linear).

### Space Complexity

- **O(1)**: No extra space.

            totalCapacity += cap;
        }
        
        long totalPeople = totalCapacity - refunds.length;
        
        if (totalPeople <= 0) return 0; // Should not happen based on constraints (at least 1 person? or empty?)
        // If empty, return 0? Or 1? Problem says "highest occupied". If 0 people, 0.
        
        for (int i = 0; i < r; i++) {
            totalPeople -= capacities[i];
            if (totalPeople <= 0) {
                return i + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return r;
    }
}

    for i in range(r):
        total_people -= capacities[i]
        if total_people <= 0:
            return i + 1
            
    return r

    capacities = []
    for _ in range(r):
        capacities.append(int(next(iterator)))
        
    # Skip refunds details as we only need count
    # But we must consume the input
    for _ in range(n):
        next(iterator) # row
        next(iterator) # seat
        
    # Note: refunds list in function signature is just for compatibility with template
    # We can pass a dummy list or just use n
    print(highest_occupied_row(r, capacities, [0]*n))

});
```

## 🧪 Test Case Walkthrough (Dry Run)

**Input:**
```
3 3
5 4 3
3 1
3 2
2 1
```

**Step 1:** Total Capacity = `5 + 4 + 3 = 12`.
**Step 2:** Total Refunds = 3.
**Step 3:** Total People = `12 - 3 = 9`.

**Iteration:**
- **Row 1 (Cap 5):** `9 - 5 = 4`. Remaining > 0. Continue.
- **Row 2 (Cap 4):** `4 - 4 = 0`. Remaining <= 0. Return `2`.

**Result:** 2.

## ✅ Proof of Correctness

### Invariant
We always fill the lowest indexed rows to their maximum capacity.
Since the problem allows moving people (implied by "minimize highest row"), the optimal configuration is a "water filling" (or rather, sediment settling) approach where people settle at the bottom.
The highest occupied row is simply the level the "sediment" reaches.
Any other configuration would have a person in a higher row while a lower row has vacancy, which could be improved by moving that person down.

## 💡 Interview Extensions

- **Extension 1:** What if moving a person costs money?
  - *Answer:* Then we need to balance the cost of moving vs the benefit of closing a row.
- **Extension 2:** What if rows have different prices and we want to maximize revenue?
  - *Answer:* Fill the most expensive rows first.
- **Extension 3:** What if we can't move people, just pick which refunds to accept?
  - *Answer:* Then we greedily accept refunds from the highest rows.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Simulating Moves**
   - ❌ Wrong: Actually moving items in an array.
   - ✅ Correct: Just count totals.

2. **Ignoring Capacity**
   - ❌ Wrong: Assuming all rows have same capacity.
   - ✅ Correct: Use the `capacities` array.

3. **Off-by-one**
   - ❌ Wrong: Returning 0-indexed row.
   - ✅ Correct: Return 1-indexed row.
