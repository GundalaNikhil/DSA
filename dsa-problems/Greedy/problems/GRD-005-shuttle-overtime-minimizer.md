# GRD-005: Shuttle Overtime Minimizer

## Problem Statement

You manage shuttle driver shifts where each shift `i` has:

- A standard length `l[i]` hours (no overtime cost for these hours)
- An overtime cost `p[i]` per hour beyond the standard length

You must cover a total of `H` hours using these shifts. Shifts can be partially used, but any hours beyond the standard length incur overtime costs at rate `p[i]`.

Your goal is to minimize the total overtime cost while covering all `H` hours.

## Input Format

- First line: two integers `n H` (number of shifts and total hours needed)
- Next `n` lines: two integers `l p` representing standard length and overtime cost per hour for each shift

## Output Format

- Single integer: minimum total overtime cost

## Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= l[i], p[i] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= H <= 10^12`
- Total standard hours (sum of all `l[i]`) may be less than, equal to, or greater than `H`

## Example

**Input:**

```
2 8
4 3
2 1
```

**Output:**

```
4
```

**Explanation:**

Shifts:

- Shift 1: 4 standard hours, overtime costs 3 per hour
- Shift 2: 2 standard hours, overtime costs 1 per hour

Total hours needed: 8

Strategy:

Strategy to minimize cost:

1. Use all standard hours first: 4 + 2 = 6 hours (no overtime cost)
2. Need 2 more hours (8 - 6 = 2)
3. For overtime, choose the cheaper rate (shift 2 at cost 1 per hour)
4. Overtime cost: 2 × 1 = 2

Total minimum cost: 2

## Notes

- First use all standard hours from all shifts (these are free)
- For remaining hours, use overtime from shifts with lowest overtime costs
- Use a min-heap to track available overtime costs
- If total standard hours >= H, answer is 0
- Time complexity: O(n log n) for sorting by overtime cost
