# GRD-006: Robotics Component Bundling with Loss and Quality Score

## Problem Statement

You have `n` robot parts, where each part `i` has:

- Weight `w[i]`
- Quality score `q[i]`

You can bundle two parts together using the following rules:

- **Weight calculation**: When bundling parts with weights `w_big` and `w_small` (where `w_big >= w_small`), the new weight is: `w_big + w_small - floor(0.1 × w_small)`
  - This represents a 10% material loss from the smaller part
- **Quality calculation**: When bundling parts with qualities `q[i]` and `q[j]`, the new quality is: `min(q[i], q[j]) - 1`
  - Quality degrades by 1 due to the bundling process

**Constraint**: All intermediate bundles must maintain quality >= T (threshold), otherwise they become unusable.

Your goal is to bundle all parts into a single component while maximizing the final weight. Return the maximum achievable weight, or `-1` if no valid bundling sequence exists.

## Input Format

- First line: two integers `n T` (number of parts and quality threshold)
- Second line: `n` space-separated integers representing weights `w[0], w[1], ..., w[n-1]`
- Third line: `n` space-separated integers representing qualities `q[0], q[1], ..., q[n-1]`

## Output Format

- Single integer: maximum final weight achievable, or `-1` if impossible

## Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 2*10^5`
- `1 <= w[i] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= q[i] <= 100`
- `1 <= T <= 100`

## Example

**Input:**

```
3 5
4 3 2
10 8 6
```

**Output:**

```
8
```

**Explanation:**

Parts: weights [4, 3, 2], qualities [10, 8, 6]
Threshold: T = 5

Valid bundling sequence:

1. Bundle parts with weights 3 and 2, qualities 8 and 6:

   - New weight: 3 + 2 - floor(0.1 × 2) = 5 - 0 = 5
   - New quality: min(8, 6) - 1 = 5 (meets threshold!)
   - Now have: [4, 5] with qualities [10, 5]

2. Bundle parts with weights 4 and 3, qualities 10 and 8:

   - Weight: 4 + 3 - floor(0.1 × 3) = 7 - 0 = 7
   - Quality: min(10, 8) - 1 = 7

3. Bundle the result (weight 7, quality 7) with the part (weight 2, quality 6):
   - Weight: 7 + 2 - floor(0.1 × 2) = 9 - 0 = 9
   - Quality: min(7, 6) - 1 = 5

Final weight = 9, quality maintained at 5.

## Notes

- Use a max-heap to track (weight, quality) pairs
- Always try to bundle pairs that maintain quality >= T
- The 10% loss applies to the smaller weight
- Greedy strategy: prioritize maintaining quality while maximizing weight
- Time complexity: O(n log n) for heap operations

## Solution Template

### Java

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public long maxBundleWeight(int n, int T, int[] weights, int[] qualities) {
        // Your implementation here
        return -1;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int T = sc.nextInt();

        int[] weights = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            weights[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }

        int[] qualities = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            qualities[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }

        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.maxBundleWeight(n, T, weights, qualities));
        sc.close();
    }
}
```

### Python

```python
import heapq
from typing import List

def max_bundle_weight(n: int, T: int, weights: List[int], qualities: List[int]) -> int:
    # Your implementation here
    return -1

def main():
    n, T = map(int, input().split())
    weights = list(map(int, input().split()))
    qualities = list(map(int, input().split()))

    result = max_bundle_weight(n, T, weights, qualities)
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long maxBundleWeight(int n, int T, vector<int>& weights, vector<int>& qualities) {
        // Your implementation here
        return -1;
    }
};

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    int n, T;
    cin >> n >> T;

    vector<int> weights(n), qualities(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> weights[i];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> qualities[i];
    }

    Solution solution;
    cout << solution.maxBundleWeight(n, T, weights, qualities) << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
const readline = require("readline");

class Solution {
  maxBundleWeight(n, T, weights, qualities) {
    // Your implementation here
    return -1;
  }
}

const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout,
});

let data = [];
rl.on("line", (line) => data.push(line.trim()));
rl.on("close", () => {
  let ptr = 0;
  const [n, T] = data[ptr++].split(" ").map(Number);
  const weights = data[ptr++].split(" ").map(Number);
  const qualities = data[ptr++].split(" ").map(Number);

  const solution = new Solution();
  console.log(solution.maxBundleWeight(n, T, weights, qualities));
});
```
