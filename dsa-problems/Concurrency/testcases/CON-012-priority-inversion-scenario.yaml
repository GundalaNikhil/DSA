problem_id: CON_PRIORITY_INVERSION__8F42
samples:
- input: 'Threads: H (high), M (medium), L (low)

    L holds a lock needed by H

    M keeps running'
  output: Must describe how M prevents L from releasing lock, delaying H; mitigation via priority inheritance/ceiling.
public:
- input: Real-time system with priorities and mutex
  output: Answer should include timeline + mitigation and at least one caveat (chaining, overhead).
hidden:
- input: Multiple locks causing transitive blocking
  output: Mention that priority inheritance can propagate across lock chains.
