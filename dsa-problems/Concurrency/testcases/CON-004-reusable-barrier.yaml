problem_id: CON_REUSABLE_BARRIER__61E2
samples:
  - input: |-
      N=3
      phase1 arrivals: T1, T2, T3
      phase2 arrivals: T2, T3, T1
    output: |-
      All threads must be released together per phase; barrier must reset between phases.
public:
  - input: |-
      N=1
      phase1: T1 arrives
      phase2: T1 arrives
    output: |-
      Trivial barrier: thread proceeds immediately each phase.
hidden:
  - input: |-
      N=4
      repeated phases
    output: |-
      Must use generation/phase separation (or two-turnstile) to avoid reuse bugs.
