problem_id: CON_BACKOFF_RETRY__1CC6
samples:
  - input: |-
      initialDelay=1ms
      maxDelay=8ms
      operation fails twice then succeeds
    output: |-
      Retry delays should grow (1ms, 2ms) then success; should mention cap and jitter if relevant.
public:
  - input: |-
      many threads retry same operation
    output: |-
      Explain thundering herd and why exponential backoff reduces contention.
hidden:
  - input: |-
      persistent failure
    output: |-
      Must bound retries and return failure / fallback; infinite retry can livelock.
