problem_id: CON_CAS_INC_ABA__4CE0
samples:
- input: 'initial x=0

    3 threads call atomicIncrement()'
  output: Final x must be 3 (no lost increments); answer should mention CAS loop + retry.
public:
- input: 'ABA scenario (stack):

    T1 reads top=A

    T2 changes A->B->A

    T1 CAS succeeds incorrectly'
  output: Must explain why A->B->A breaks CAS assumptions and name a mitigation (tag/version, hazard pointers, epoch).
hidden:
- input: pointer-based lock-free structure with reclamation
  output: Must mention memory reclamation and how it relates to ABA / use-after-free.
