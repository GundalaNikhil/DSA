problem_id: CON_DINING_ASYM_FORKS__2F6E
samples:
- input: 'P=5

    forks=[normal, two-hand, normal, two-hand, normal]'
  output: Must prevent circular wait; protocol should explicitly handle two-hand forks and argue fairness (no starvation).
public:
- input: 'P=5

    forks=[two-hand, two-hand, two-hand, two-hand, two-hand]'
  output: Protocol should still avoid deadlock (likely via an arbiter/waiter) and be fair.
hidden:
- input: 'P=10000

    mixed fork types'
  output: Design must scale; avoid global hot locks on every action unless justified.
