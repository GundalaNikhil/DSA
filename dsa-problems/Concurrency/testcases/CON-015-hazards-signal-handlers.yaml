problem_id: CON_SIGNAL_HANDLER_SAFETY__6B90
samples:
  - input: |-
      signal arrives during malloc
    output: |-
      Handler must not call malloc/printf/locking; should only set a flag and return (optionally write() to a pipe).
public:
  - input: |-
      need to notify event loop of signal
    output: |-
      Mention self-pipe trick or eventfd; handler uses async-signal-safe operations only.
hidden:
  - input: |-
      handler does too much work
    output: |-
      Must state: keep handler minimal; defer work to normal thread context.
