problem_id: CON_CONDVAR_WAIT_LOOP__3A0D
samples:
- input: 'shared flag=false

    waiter starts waiting

    signaler sets flag=true and signals'
  output: Wait must be in a while-loop rechecking predicate; lost wakeups avoided by holding lock during update+signal.
public:
- input: spurious wakeup occurs
  output: Waiter must not proceed unless predicate is true; loop is mandatory.
hidden:
- input: signal sent before waiter sleeps (race)
  output: Correct wait(cv, mutex) is atomic release+sleep; prevents missing the signal.
