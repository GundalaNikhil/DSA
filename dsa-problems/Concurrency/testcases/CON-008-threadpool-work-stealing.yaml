samples:
  - input: |-
      W=4
      worker0 has 100 tasks
      worker1/2/3 have 0 tasks
    output: |-
      Idle workers should steal from worker0's tail; completion should be balanced.
public:
  - input: |-
      W=2
      tasks spawn sub-tasks
    output: |-
      Design must handle dynamically generated tasks without global bottlenecks.
hidden:
  - input: |-
      W=64
      high contention
    output: |-
      Mention per-worker deques; thieves should not contend on one global queue.
