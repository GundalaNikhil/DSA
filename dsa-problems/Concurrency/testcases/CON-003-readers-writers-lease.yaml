problem_id: CON_RW_LEASE__D08C
samples:
- input: 'L=50ms

    t=0: readers acquire

    t=20: writer arrives

    t=40: readers try to renew'
  output: Writer should eventually proceed after at most one lease window if renewals are blocked while writer is waiting.
public:
- input: 'L=200ms

    continuous readers arrive

    one writer arrives at t=10ms'
  output: Design must block new readers and deny renewals to prevent writer starvation.
hidden:
- input: 'L=1000ms

    reader pauses (simulated GC) beyond L

    writer arrives mid-way'
  output: Lease mechanism should bound how long the writer waits; renewal policy is critical.
