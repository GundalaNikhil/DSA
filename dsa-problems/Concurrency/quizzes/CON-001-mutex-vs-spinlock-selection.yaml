    question: If the expected wait time (w) is many times larger than the critical section (cs), which lock is usually better?
    options:
      - Spinlock
      - Mutex
      - Recursive Lock
      - None
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A Mutex allows the thread to sleep, freeing the CPU for other tasks, which is more efficient for long waits.

    question: What is the primary disadvantage of a Spinlock?
    options:
      - Uses too much memory
      - Causes frequent context switches
      - Wastes CPU cycles by busy-waiting in a loop
      - It is slow for short critical sections
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Spinlocks continuously check if the lock is available, consuming CPU power even while waiting.

    question: What is the primary overhead associated with a Mutex?
    options:
      - CPU burning
      - Context-switch and scheduler latency
      - Memory leak risk
      - Complexity
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Parking and unparking a thread involves a non-trivial context switch cost by the OS.

    question: In an oversubscribed system (more threads than CPU cores), why is a spinlock particularly dangerous?
    options:
      - It can dead-lock easily
      - A thread might spin for its entire time slice while the lock holder is preempted
      - It doesn't support oversubscription
      - It is too fast
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: If the lock holder is not currently running, the spinning thread will never see the lock released until the holder is scheduled back.
