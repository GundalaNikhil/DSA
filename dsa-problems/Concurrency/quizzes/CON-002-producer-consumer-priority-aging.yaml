  question: What is 'starvation' in the context of a priority queue?
  options:
  - The queue running out of memory
  - Low-priority items being perpetually ignored due to constant high-priority arrivals
  - Producers blocking consumers
  - Threads crashing
  correct_answer: 1
  explanation: If new high-priority items always arrive, low-priority ones may never be dequeued.

  question: How does 'aging' solve the starvation problem?
  options:
  - By deleting old items
  - By gradually increasing the priority of items that have waited a long time
  - By decreasing producer speed
  - By randomizing selection
  correct_answer: 1
  explanation: Eventually, even a low-priority item will age into a high-priority one and be served.

  question: When using condition variables for a bounded buffer, why should you ideally use 'while' instead of 'if' for wait conditions?
  options:
  - To avoid recursion
  - To handle spurious wakeups safely
  - For recursion support
  - It is just convention
  correct_answer: 1
  explanation: A thread may wake up without a signal or find the condition no longer true; 'while' re-checks the condition before proceeding.

  question: If aging period T=100ms, and an item has waited 250ms, what is its total priority boost?
  options:
  - '+1'
  - '+2'
  - '+3'
  - '+0'
  correct_answer: 1
  explanation: 250ms / 100ms = 2 (integer division bits). It gets +1 for every full T milliseconds.
