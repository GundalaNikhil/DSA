    question: What is the purpose of a 'condition variable'?
    options:
      - To lock a resource
      - To allow threads to wait for a specific state or event to happen

      - To handle exceptions
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Condition variables allow threads to block until another thread signals that a condition (like 'queue not empty') is met.
