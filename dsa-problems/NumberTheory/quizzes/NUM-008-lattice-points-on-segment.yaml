  - question: How many integer points lie on the segment between (0,0) and (4,4)?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "5"
      - "4"
      - "3"
      - "2"

  - question: "The number of integer points on segment from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2) is given by:"
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - GCD(|x1-x2|, |y1-y2|) + 1
      - GCD(x1, y1) + GCD(x2, y2)
      - "|x1-x2| + |y1-y2|"
      - Sqrt(|x1-x2|^2 + |y1-y2|^2)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: If slope reduces to dy/dx, we step GCD times. (+1 for end point).

  - question: If two points have no integer points between them (e.g., (0,0) to (2,3)), what is the GCD of their differences?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "1"
      - "0"
      - "2"
      - "3"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: GCD(2, 3) is 1. Formula gives 1+1=2 points (the endpoints themselves). So 0 points *between*.

      - Euler's Formula
      - Shoelace Formula
      - Heron's Formula
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Area = Interior + Boundary/2 - 1.
