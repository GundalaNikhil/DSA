questions:
  - question: This problem is a variation of the 'Max Points on a Line' problem. What is the typical constraint?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Points must be on a segment of limited length L
      - Points must be collinear
      - Points must have integer coordinates
      - Infinite line
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The 'limit' implies we care about distance or a bounding box constraint along the line.

  - question: "To solve Max Points on a Line, we typically use:"
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - GCD to normalize slopes
      - Sorting by X coordinate
      - DFS
      - Dynamic Programming
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We group points by the slope (dy/dx) relative to an anchor point.

  - question: When calculating slope between (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), why is floating point division risky?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Precision errors
      - It is slower
      - It cannot handle infinity
      - It consumes more memory
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Small precision errors can make distinct slopes appear equal. Using GCD-reduced fraction pairs is safer.

  - question: How do we handle vertical lines (undefined slope)?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Treat as a special pair (0, 1) or separate counter
      - Use infinity
      - Ignore them
      - Rotate the grid
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Vertical lines have dx=0, so we can encode the slope as (0, 1) after GCD reduction.
