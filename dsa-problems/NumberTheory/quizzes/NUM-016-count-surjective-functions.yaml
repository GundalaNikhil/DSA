  - question: "A surjective function from set A (size n) to set B (size k) means:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Every element in B is mapped to by at least one element in A
      - Every element in A maps to a unique element in B
      - n must be equal to k
      - The mapping is random
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Surjective (onto) means the range covers the entire codomain.

    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
      - Simply k^n
      - n!
      - k!
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Total functions - (functions missing 1 element) + (functions missing 2)...

  - question: "S(n, k) denotes Stirling numbers of the second kind. The number of surjections is:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - k! * S(n, k)
      - S(n, k)
      - n! * S(n, k)
      - S(k, n)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: S(n, k) partitions n items into k non-empty sets. Ordering the k sets gives k!.

  - question: If n < k, how many surjective functions exist?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "0"
      - "1"
      - k!
