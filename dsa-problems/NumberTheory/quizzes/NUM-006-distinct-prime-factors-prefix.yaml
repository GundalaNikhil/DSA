    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - 30 (2*3*5)
      - 16 (2^4)
      - 12 (2^2*3)
      - 7 (7)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: 30 has 3 distinct factors (2, 3, 5). 16 has 1. 12 has 2. 7 has 1.

  - question: What is the approximate maximum number of distinct prime factors for a number N <= 10^9?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - ~10
      - ~30
      - ~100
      - ~500
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Product of the first 10 primes exceeds 10^9, so it's very small.
