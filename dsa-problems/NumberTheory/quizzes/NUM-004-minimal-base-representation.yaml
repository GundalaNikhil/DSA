    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - 2 to 36
      - 1 to 10
      - 2 to X
      - 10 to 16

  - question: Why is the optimal approach simply iterating all bases?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - The number of bases (35) is very small constant
      - It is impossible otherwise
      - Base conversion is O(1)
      - We cannot predict digit sums
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Checking 35 bases is effectively O(log X) total, which is extremely efficient.

  - question: What is the time complexity to find the digit sum of X in one specific base B?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(log_B X)
      - O(X)
      - O(B)
      - O(1)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The number of digits is proportional to log base B of X.

  - question: If X=10, what is its digit sum in Base 2?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "2"
      - "1"
      - "5"
      - "10"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: 10 in binary is 1010. Sum of digits = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 2.
