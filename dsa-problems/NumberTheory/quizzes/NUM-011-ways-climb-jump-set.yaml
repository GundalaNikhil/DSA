questions:
  - question: This problem is a variation of which classic problem?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Fibonacci / Climbing Stairs
      - Tower of Hanoi
      - N-Queens
      - Knapsack

  - question: If N is very large (e.g., 10^18), how do we solve linear recurrences efficiently?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Matrix Exponentiation
      - Dynamic Programming array
      - Recursion with Memoization
      - Graph BFS
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Matrix Exponentiation computes the N-th term in O(k^3 log N) where k is the recurrence order.

  - question: For jump sizes {1, 2}, the recurrence is F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2). What is the matrix size?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - 2x2
      - 1x1
      - 3x3
      - NxN
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The state depends on previous 2 values, so a 2x2 matrix is sufficient.

  - question: "The modulo M applied at each step ensures:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Numbers don't grow infinitely large
      - We find the exact value
      - The matrix is invertible
      - Faster jumping
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Combinatorial counts grow exponentially; modulo arithmetic keeps them within integer types.
