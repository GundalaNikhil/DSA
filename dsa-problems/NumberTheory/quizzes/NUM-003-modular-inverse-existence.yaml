  - question: "The modular multiplicative inverse of A modulo M exists if and only if:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - GCD(A, M) == 1
      - A < M
      - M is prime
      - A is prime
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "This is a fundamental theorem: A has an inverse mod M iff A and M are coprime."

  - question: "According to Fermat's Little Theorem, if M is prime, the inverse of A is:"
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - A^(M-2) % M
      - A^(M-1) % M
      - A^(M) % M
      - It doesn't exist
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Since A^(M-1) = 1 mod M, multiplying by A^-1 gives A^(M-2) = A^-1.

  - question: Which algorithm is used to find the modular inverse when M is NOT prime?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Extended Euclidean Algorithm
      - Sieve of Eratosthenes
      - Binary Exponentiation
      - Prime Factorization
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Extended Euclidean finds x, y such that Ax + My = gcd(A, M). If gcd is 1, x is the inverse.

  - question: What is the time complexity of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(log(min(A, M)))
      - O(A + M)
      - O(sqrt(M))
      - O(1)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Like standard Euclidean algorithm, it is logarithmic.
