  - question: The Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) solves a system of congruences x = a_i (mod m_i). What is the main requirement?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Moduli m_i must be pairwise coprime
      - Moduli m_i must be prime
      - a_i must be less than m_i
      - a_i must be prime
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: If moduli are not coprime, a solution might not exist or might not be unique modulo Product(m_i).

  - question: "If moduli are NOT pairwise coprime, solving the system requires:"
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - "Checking compatibility condition: a1 = a2 (mod gcd(m1, m2))"
      - It is impossible
      - Just multiplying them
      - Ignoring the conflict
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We combine equations two by two, ensuring they agree on the GCD of their moduli.

  - question: "The unique solution for CRT exists modulo:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Product of all m_i
      - Sum of all m_i
      - LCM of all m_i
      - Max of m_i
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Or LCM if they are not coprime. For coprime, Product == LCM.

      - Binary Search
      - Sieve
      - DFS
    correct_answer: 0
