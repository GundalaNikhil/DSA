  - question: "Wilson's Theorem states that for a prime P, (P-1)! is congruent to:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - -1 mod P
      - 1 mod P
      - 0 mod P
      - P mod P
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: (P-1)! = -1 mod P is a key primality test condition.

  - question: What is the Legendre's Formula used for?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - finding the exponent of a prime P in N!
      - finding the last digit of N!
      - finding if N is prime
      - calculating gcd of factorials
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Sum of floor(N/P^k) gives the exponent of prime P in the prime factorization of N!.

  - question: "To find the number of trailing zeros in N!, we count factors of:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "5"
      - "2"
      - "10"
      - "3"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Since pairs of (2,5) make 10, and 5 is rarer than 2, the count of factor 5 determines zeros.

  - question: If N! % P == 0, what does it imply about P?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - P <= N
      - P > N
      - P is prime
      - P is composite
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: If P <= N, then P is one of the multipliers in 1*2*...*P*...*N, so N! is divisible by P.
