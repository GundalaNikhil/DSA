  - question: LCM(A, B) is related to GCD(A, B) by which formula?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - (A * B) / GCD(A, B)
      - A * B * GCD(A, B)
      - GCD(A, B) / (A * B)
      - A + B
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Product equals LCM * GCD.

  - question: To compute LCM of a range [L, R] efficiently without overflow, what property is useful?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - It is the max power of each prime P <= R that appears in the range
      - It is the product of all primes in the range
      - It is R!
      - It is simply LCM(L, R)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: For each prime, find the largest P^k <= R. The LCM is the product of these maximal prime powers.
