  - question: Using a Prefix GCD array, how fast can we answer a query for the GCD of the first K elements?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(1)
      - O(K)
      - O(log K)
      - O(N)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Since we precompute prefix[i] = GCD(prefix[i-1], A[i]), the answer is just prefix[K-1].

  - question: What is the time complexity to build the Prefix GCD array?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(N * log(max_val))
      - O(N)
      - O(N^2)
      - O(1)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We iterate N times, and each GCD step takes logarithmic time with respect to the values.

  - question: Does GCD(A, B, C) equal GCD(A, GCD(B, C))?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Yes, GCD is associative
      - No, order matters
      - Only for prime numbers
      - Only for positive integers
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "The Greatest Common Divisor operation is associative: gcd(a, b, c) = gcd(a, gcd(b, c))."
