questions:
  - question: For input 123, what are the possible split products?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - 1*23=23, 12*3=36
      - 1+23=24, 12+3=15
      - 123, 321
      - "6"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Splits are (1, 23) and (12, 3).

  - question: "Since the number of digits is small (<= 12), the optimal approach is:"
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Brute Force all split positions
      - Dynamic Programming
      - Greedy
      - Binary Search
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: With only ~11 split positions, trying all is O(number of digits), which is negligible.

  - question: If a split results in a product of 0 (e.g., 10 split into 1, 0), is it valid?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Usually valid, but check problem statement for 'non-zero' constraint
      - Always invalid
      - Always minimal
      - Causes error
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Typically we seek minimal non-negative or non-zero product.

  - question: What is the time complexity in terms of number of digits D?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(D)
      - O(D^2)
      - O(2^D)
      - O(D!)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We iterate D-1 times, doing constant work (string slicing/converting).
