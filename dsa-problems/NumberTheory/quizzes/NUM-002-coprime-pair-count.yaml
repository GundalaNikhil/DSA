    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "1"
      - "0"
      - Their product
      - The smaller of the two
    correct_answer: 0

  - question: Euler's Totient Function phi(N) counts what?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Numbers <= N coprime to N
      - Divisors of N
      - Prime factors of N
      - Multiples of N
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Phi(N) is the count of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n.

  - question: For a prime number P, what is phi(P)?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - P - 1
      - P
      - "1"
      - P/2
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Since P is prime, all numbers from 1 to P-1 are coprime to P.

  - question: "If we need to count coprime pairs (i, j) where 1 <= i, j <= N, we can sum:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - 2 * (Sum of phi(i) for i=1 to N) - 1
      - Sum of phi(i) for i=1 to N
      - N * N
      - N!
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: This formula accounts for symmetry (a,b) and (b,a) and the unique case (1,1).
