  - question: This problem asks for the number of strings of length N with exactly K vowels. Which principle is key?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Combinations (nCk) * Vowel choices * Consonant choices
      - Permutations only
      - Fibonacci sequence
      - Matrix Exponentiation
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Choose K indices for vowels, then fill them with 5 options, fill rest with 21 options.

    options:
      - Modular Inverse for C(N, K) and Modular Exponentiation
      - BigInt arithmetic only
      - Recursion
      - Approximation
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Division in C(N, K) requires modular inverse. Powers require binary exponentiation.

  - question: If K > N, what is the answer?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "0"
      - "1"
      - N!
      - Infinite
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: You cannot have more vowels than the total length of the string.

  - question: Why do we use modular arithmetic in this problem?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - The count of strings grows exponentially
      - To handle negative numbers
      - Because vowels are few
      - It is required for ASCII
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Even for small N=10, the count is huge. We need modulo to fit in standard integers.
