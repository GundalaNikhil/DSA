questions:
  - question: The Flajolet-Martin algorithm relies on observing what property of hash values?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Number of trailing zeros in binary representation
      - Number of set bits
      - Whether the number is prime
      - Last digit in decimal
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Observing k trailing zeros occurs with probability 1/2^k, indicating ~2^k distinct elements.

  - question: What is a major characteristic of the basic Flajolet-Martin estimate R = 2^L?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - High variance (needs averaging)
      - High bias
      - Low variance
      - Exactness
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Powers of 2 are coarse granular steps. We need stochastic averaging (Mean of means/medians) to smooth it.

  - question: "The constant phi = 0.77351 is used to:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Correct the bias of the geometric mean estimate
      - Convert binary to decimal
      - Generate hash functions
      - Limit the memory
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: It's a mathematical correction factor derived from the probabilistic analysis.
