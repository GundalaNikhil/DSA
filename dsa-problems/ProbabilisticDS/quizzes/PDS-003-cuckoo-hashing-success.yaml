questions:
  - question: Cuckoo Hashing typically uses how many hash tables/functions?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "2"
      - "1"
      - N
      - Log N
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Ideally 2 tables. An item is stored in T1[h1(x)] or T2[h2(x)].

  - question: What happens if an insertion creates a cycle of displacements?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Rehash everything with new functions
      - Use a stash
      - Discard the element
      - Both A and B are common strategies
    correct_answer: 3
    explanation: Infinite loops mean the table is too partitioned or full. We must rehash or use a small stash.

  - question: What is the worst-case lookup time in Cuckoo Hashing?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(1)
      - O(log N)
      - O(N)
      - O(K)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We only check 2 specific locations. Constant worst-case time!

  - question: "To ensure high success probability for insertion, the load factor should generally be below:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - 50%
      - 90%
      - 10%
      - 30%
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: With 2 tables, capacity drops sharply above 50% load due to cycles.
