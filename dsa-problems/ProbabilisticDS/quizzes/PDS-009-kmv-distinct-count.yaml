questions:
  - question: "K-Minimum Values (KMV) is a technique used to estimate:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Number of distinct elements (Cardinality)
      - Heavy Hitters
      - Graph diameter
      - Median value
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: By tracking the k smallest hash values, we can infer the density of the hash space and thus the total count.

  - question: "The KMV estimator formula is typically:"
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - (K - 1) / Max(Kth smallest hash)
      - K / Average(K hashes)
      - K * N
      - Sum of K hashes
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Specifically, if hashes are normalized to [0,1], count is approximately (K-1)/U_(k).

  - question: "One major advantage of KMV over HyperLogLog is:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Supports set operations (Union, Intersection) easily
      - Uses less memory
      - Faster updates
      - No hashing required
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Since we store actual hash values (samples), we can merge them to estimate intersections accurately.

  - question: What is the space complexity of KMV?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(K)
      - O(N)
      - O(log N)
      - O(1)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We store a fixed-size heap or list of K values.
