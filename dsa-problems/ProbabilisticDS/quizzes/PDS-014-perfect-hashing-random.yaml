  - question: Perfect Hashing guarantees what performance characteristic?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(1) worst-case lookup time
      - O(1) amortized lookup time
      - O(log N) lookup time
      - O(N) space compression
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: By eliminating collisions entirely, we ensure constant time access.

  - question: "The FKS (Fredman, Komlos, Szemeredi) scheme uses a two-level approach. The second level tables have size proportional to:"
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Square of the number of items in that bucket (n_i^2)
      - Number of items (n_i)
      - Log of items (log n_i)
      - Fixed constant
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Using n_i^2 space ensures that a collision-free hash function exists with probability > 1/2.

  - question: "Despite using n_i^2 size for buckets, the total space complexity remains:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(N) linear
      - O(N^2) quadratic
      - O(N log N)
      - O(1)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The sum of squares of bucket sizes E[sum n_i^2] is O(N) for a good first-level hash.

  - question: Is Perfect Hashing suitable for rapidly changing datasets?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - No, usually requires static set or expensive rebuilds
      - Yes, it adapts easily
      - Only for append-only data
      - Yes, using linked lists
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Finding the collision-free functions is a construction-time heavy process.
