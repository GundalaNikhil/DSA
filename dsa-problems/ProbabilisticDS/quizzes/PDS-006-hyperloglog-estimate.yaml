questions:
  - question: "HyperLogLog is famous for estimating cardinality with:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Extremely low memory (Kb for billions of items)
      - Zero error
      - Linear memory O(N)
      - Quadratic speed
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Typically uses ~1.5 KB to estimate counts up to billions with ~2% error.

  - question: "The standard error of HLL is proportional to:"
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - 1 / sqrt(M)
      - 1 / M
      - M
      - log M
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Increasing registers M reduces error by the square root law.

  - question: Why does HLL use the *Harmonic Mean* of the register values instead of the Arithmetic Mean?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - To reduce the influence of outliers (unlucky large hash runs)
      - It is faster to calculate
      - Arithmetic mean is undefined
      - It increases the range
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Arithmetic mean is easily skewed by a single large value (e.g., getting 30 trailing zeros by change).

  - question: What does the register value typically store?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - The maximum number of leading/trailing zeros seen for that bucket
      - The count of items in that bucket
      - The sum of hash values
      - The actual items
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We track the 'rarest' event (longest run of zeros) to estimate magnitude.
