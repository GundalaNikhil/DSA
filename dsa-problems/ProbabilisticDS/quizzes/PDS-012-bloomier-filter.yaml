  - question: "A Bloomier Filter extends the standard Bloom Filter by allowing:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Storage of arbitrary values associated with keys
      - Deletion of keys
      - Counting of keys
      - Infinite capacity
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: It implements an approximate associative array (Map) rather than just a Set.

  - question: If we query a key that was NEVER inserted into the Bloomier Filter, what is returned?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - A random value (False Positive)
      - "Null"
      - An error
      - The correct value
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Like a Bloom filter, it cannot distinguish 'missing' from 'present' perfectly. It returns a value constructed from XORs.

  - question: "The probability that a non-key query returns a specific 'valid' value (false positive) is:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - 2^(-r)
      - 1/m
      - 1/N
      - "0"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Where r is the bit-width of the value cells. It's the chance of r random bits matching.

  - question: What is the critical failure mode during Bloomier Filter construction?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Cyclic dependencies in the cuckoo graph
      - Hash collisions
      - Table full
      - Memory leak
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Construction requires solving dependencies (peeling). Cycles prevent unique determination of values.
