  - question: "To compute the union of two HLL sketches, A and B, we create a new sketch U where:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - U[i] = max(A[i], B[i])
      - U[i] = A[i] + B[i]
      - U[i] = min(A[i], B[i])
      - U[i] = average(A[i], B[i])
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The register stores the maximum trailing zeros observed. The max of the two registers represents the rarest event seen in either stream.

  - question: Why can't we just add the estimated cardinalities of A and B?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Double counting of intersection elements
      - Ideally we can, but it's slow
      - HLL only supports subtraction
      - Cardinality is not a number
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "|A U B| = |A| + |B| - |A n B|. Simple addition ignores the intersection overlap."

  - question: "This merge property makes HLL extremely useful for:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Distributed systems (MapReduce/Spark aggregations)
      - Sorting arrays
      - Finding shortest paths
      - Encryption
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Sketches can be computed locally on shards and then merged cheaply at the reducer level.

  - question: What is the time complexity to merge two HLL sketches of size M?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(M)
      - O(M^2)
      - O(1)
      - O(M log M)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We iterate through the M registers once.
