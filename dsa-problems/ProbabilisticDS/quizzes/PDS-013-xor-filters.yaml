questions:
  - question: "XOR Filters are often considered a modern, more space-efficient alternative to:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Bloom Filters
      - Binary Search Trees
      - Hash Maps
      - Linked Lists
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: They typically require about 15-20% less space for the same false positive rate.

  - question: "The core construction principle of an XOR Filter involves:"
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Solving a system of linear equations over GF(2)
      - Sorting all keys
      - Finding the maximum flow
      - Building a tree
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We assign values such that B[h1] ^ B[h2] ^ B[h3] = fingerprint(key).

  - question: Can an XOR Filter typically support dynamic insertions and deletions after construction?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - No, it is a static structure
      - Yes, fully dynamic
      - Insertions only
      - Deletions only
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The dependencies are tightly coupled during construction (peeling), making updates impractical without rebuilding.

  - question: Which of these is a valid fingerprinting strategy used in XOR filters?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Storing an k-bit hash of the key
      - Storing the full key
      - Storing a boolean flag
      - Storing the index
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The fingerprint is what allows us to verify membership (probabilistically).
