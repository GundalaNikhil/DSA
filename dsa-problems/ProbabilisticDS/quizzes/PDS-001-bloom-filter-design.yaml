  - question: This problem asks to calculate optimal M (bit array size) and K (hash functions) given N and P. What is P?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - False Positive Probability
      - Total Population
      - Prime Number
      - Processing Time
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We design Bloom Filters to minimize false positives for a given capacity.

  - question: "The optimal number of hash functions K is approximately:"
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - (M / N) * ln(2)
      - M / N
      - ln(N)
      - P * N
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: This value minimizes the false positive rate for a fixed size M.

  - question: Can a Bloom Filter produce False Negatives?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - No, never
      - Yes, if full
      - Yes, with probability P
      - Only if K is small
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: If an element was inserted, the bits are set. They don't unset themselves. So we definitely find it (or a collision).

  - question: What is the time complexity to insert an element?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(K)
      - O(N)
      - O(M)
      - O(1)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We just compute K hashes and set K bits. Independent of N or M.
