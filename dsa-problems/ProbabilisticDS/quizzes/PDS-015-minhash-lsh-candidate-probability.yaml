questions:
  - question: "In MinHash LSH, we organize the signature matrix into 'b' bands of 'r' rows. A pair is a candidate if:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - They interact (match perfectly) in AT LEAST one band
      - They match in ALL bands
      - They match in strictly more than half the bands
      - They don't match anywhere
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: This OR-construction increases the probability of finding similar items.

  - question: "The probability that a pair with similarity 's' becomes a candidate is:"
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - 1 - (1 - s^r)^b
      - (1 - s)^b
      - s^r * b
      - 1 - s^(r*b)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: s^r is probability of match in one band. (1-s^r) is miss in one band. (1-s^r)^b is miss in all bands.

  - question: The plot of this probability function creates an 'S-curve'. What does the steep part represent?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - The threshold similarity where probability of detection jumps from low to high
      - The error rate
      - The speed of the algorithm
      - The memory usage
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: It effectively filters out pairs with similarity below the threshold and keeps those above.

  - question: "Increasing the number of bands 'b' (while keeping total signature length fixed) generally:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Decreases the threshold (finding more candidates, more False Positives)
      - Increases the threshold (finding fewer candidates, more False Negatives)
      - Has no effect
      - Decreases memory usage
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: More bands means more chances to collide, so we catch pairs with lower similarity.
