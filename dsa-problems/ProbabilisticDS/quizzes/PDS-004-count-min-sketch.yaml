  - question: "The estimated count in CMS is always:"
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - ">= True Count (Over-estimation)"
      - <= True Count (Under-estimation)
      - Exact
      - Randomly distributed
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Collisions only add to the counters, never subtract. So we over-estimate.

  - question: How is the query answer derived from the D rows?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Minimum of the values
      - Average of the values
      - Maximum of the values
      - Sum of the values
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Since all errors are positive (over-estimation), the smallest value is the closest to truth.

  - question: The width W of the sketch depends primarily on which parameter?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Epsilon (Error bound)
      - Delta (Failure probability)
      - N (Total items)
      - D (Depth)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: W = e / epsilon. Smaller error requires wider table.
