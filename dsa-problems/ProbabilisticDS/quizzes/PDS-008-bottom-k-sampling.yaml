  - question: "Comparing two MinHash signatures allows us to estimate:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Jaccard Similarity
      - Euclidean Distance
      - Cosine Similarity
      - Manhattan Distance
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The collision probability of min-hashes exactly matches Jaccard Index.

  - question: "The estimate is calculated as:"
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Fraction of matching signature indices
      - Sum of differences
      - Product of signatures
      - Average of values
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: If 3 out of 10 hash values match, estimate is 0.3.

  - question: Why do we use 'Bottom-K' or 'Min-Hash' values?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Because 'minimum' is an unbiased selector from the random permutation
      - Because small numbers store faster
      - Because we only care about small items
      - It sorts the data
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Under a random permutation, any element has equal chance to be the minimum.

  - question: "To improve the accuracy of Jaccard estimation, we should:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Increase K (length of signature)
      - Use larger hash values
      - Sort the input sets
      - Use worse hash functions
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Variance decreases as 1/K.
