  - question: In the exponential decay model, an item seen at time 't' contributes how much to the count at time 'T'?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - e^(-lambda * (T - t))
      - e^(lambda * (T - t))
      - lambda * (T - t)
      - 1 / (T - t)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The contribution decays exponentially with the age (T - t).

  - question: If we update the current time from T to T + dt, how does the total decayed count change?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Multiply current total by e^(-lambda * dt)
      - Subtract dt
      - Add e^(-lambda * dt)
      - Divide by dt
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: This property allows efficient online updates without recomputing the summation.

  - question: "If lambda = 0 (no decay), the result simplifies to:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - The total count of distinct elements seen so far (unweighted)
      - "0"
      - Infinity
      - "1"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: e^0 = 1, so every item contributes exactly 1, regardless of age.

  - question: "This decay mechanism is most useful for:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Tracking trending topics or recent activity
      - Archival storage
      - Exact counting
      - Cryptography
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: It gives higher weight to recent events, naturally filtering out old 'stale' data.
