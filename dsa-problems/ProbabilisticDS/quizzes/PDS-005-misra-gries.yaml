  - question: "The Misra-Gries algorithm is designed to find frequent elements. Specifically, it finds all elements with frequency greater than:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - N / K
      - N / 2
      - N
      - Sqrt(N)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Using K-1 counters allows tracking elements that appear more than 1/K fraction of the time.

  - question: Does Misra-Gries produce False Positives or False Negatives?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - False Positives only (It may report infrequent items)
      - False Negatives only (It may miss frequent items)
      - Both
      - Neither, it is exact
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: It guarantees capturing all heavy hitters (no FN), but might include some lighter items (FP).

  - question: What is the space complexity of Misra-Gries?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(K)
      - O(N)
      - O(N/K)
      - O(1) if K is variable
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We store exactly K-1 counters and keys.

  - question: When a new element arrives and the map is full (with different keys), what happens?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Decrement all existing counters by 1
      - Ignore the new element
      - Replace the minimum counter
      - Increase map size
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "This is the core mechanic: we 'pair off' distinct elements to reduce the count of all candidates."
