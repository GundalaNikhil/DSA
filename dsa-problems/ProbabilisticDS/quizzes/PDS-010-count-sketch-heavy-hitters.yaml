questions:
  - question: How does Count Sketch differ from Count-Min Sketch in its update mechanism?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - It adds +1 or -1 based on a second hash function
      - It only increments
      - It uses a linked list
      - It sorts the counters
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The random sign (+/- 1) ensures that collisions average out to zero in expectation.

  - question: "The estimate for an item in Count Sketch is taken as:"
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - The median of the row estimates
      - The minimum of the row estimates
      - The maximum of the row estimates
      - The sum of the row estimates
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Since the estimator is unbiased, the median is robust against large noise (outliers) from collisions.

  - question: Is Count Sketch an unbiased estimator?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Yes, E[estimate] = true_count
      - No, it overestimates
      - No, it underestimates
      - Only for positive counts
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The expected value of the noise from other items is 0 due to the random signs.

  - question: Count Sketch typically requires more or less space than Count-Min Sketch for the same error bounds?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - More space (width depends on 1/epsilon^2)
      - Less space
      - Same space
      - Depends on delta
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: CMS width is proportional to 1/epsilon, while Count Sketch is 1/epsilon^2 for L2 norm error.
