  - question: What is the maximum degree of the interpolating polynomial through k points?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - k
      - k-1
      - 2k
      - Depends on MOD
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: With k distinct x_i, the unique interpolating polynomial has degree at most k-1.

  - question: For points (0,1) and (1,3), what is P(2)?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "4"
      - "5"
      - "6"
      - "7"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The line is P(x)=1+2x, so P(2)=5.

  - question: Why must all x_i be distinct?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - To avoid division by zero in Lagrange basis
      - To make the modulus prime
      - To ensure P is monic
      - To keep coefficients small
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Lagrange basis uses (x_i - x_j) in denominators, requiring distinct x_i.

  - question: What is the naive time complexity of Lagrange interpolation for one query?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(k)
      - O(k^2)
      - O(k log k)
      - O(log k)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Direct evaluation of all basis polynomials is O(k^2).
