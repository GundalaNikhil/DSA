questions:
  - question: Why is CRT used in this problem?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - To avoid padding
      - Because MOD may not be NTT-friendly
      - To reduce output length
      - Because inputs are negative
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: CRT combines results from NTT-friendly primes to match an arbitrary MOD.

    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - "1"
      - 2-3
      - 5-6
      - "10"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Using 2-3 primes is common to cover 64-bit ranges safely.

  - question: What is the output length of the convolution?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - n + m - 1
      - max(n, m)
      - n * m
      - next power of two
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Convolution of lengths n and m has length n+m-1.
