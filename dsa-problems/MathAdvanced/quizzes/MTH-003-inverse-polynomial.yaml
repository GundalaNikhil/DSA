  - question: What condition is required for P(x) to have an inverse mod x^n?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - P has degree less than n
      - P[0] is non-zero modulo MOD
      - All coefficients are non-zero
      - P is monic
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A polynomial is invertible mod x^n iff its constant term is non-zero mod MOD.

  - question: For P(x)=1+x, n=3, what is Q(x) such that P*Q ≡ 1 (mod x^3)?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - 1 + x + x^2
      - 1 - x + x^2
      - 1 - x
      - 1 + x
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: (1+x)(1-x+x^2)=1+x^3, so modulo x^3 it is 1.

  - question: What is the Newton iteration update formula?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Q_{i+1} = Q_i * (2 - P * Q_i) mod x^{2^i}
      - Q_{i+1} = Q_i + P
      - Q_{i+1} = Q_i * P
      - Q_{i+1} = Q_i - P
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Newton's method doubles precision with Q_{i+1} = Q_i(2 - P Q_i).

  - question: What is the time complexity using NTT-based multiplications?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(n^2)
      - O(n log n)
      - O(log n)
      - O(n)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Doubling steps with NTT give O(n log n).
