    question: What does the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) solve?
    options:
      - Systems of linear congruences with pairwise coprime moduli
      - Matrix multiplication
      - Polynomial roots
      - Shortest paths
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: CRT provides a unique solution (modulo the product of moduli) for a system of linear congruences.

    question: What is the requirement for the moduli m1, m2, ..., mk in the standard CRT?
    options:
      - They must be prime
      - They must be pairwise coprime
      - They must be equal
      - They must be even
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Pairwise coprimality ensures that the solution exists and is unique modulo the product.

    question: How is CRT used in large number arithmetic?
    options:
      - To reduce memory
      - To perform calculations on small residues and reconstruct the large result
      - To sort numbers
      - To find primes
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Calculating with smaller moduli can be faster than multiple-precision arithmetic.

    question: If moduli are not coprime, what algorithm handles the system of congruences?
    options:
      - FFT
      - Extended Euclidean Algorithm (General CRT)
      - Dijkstra
      - Binary Search
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The Extended Euclidean Algorithm can solve a pair of congruences even if the moduli are not coprime, provided the conditions for existence are met.
