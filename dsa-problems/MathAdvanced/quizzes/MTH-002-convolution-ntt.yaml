  - question: What is the output length?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - max(n, m)
      - n + m - 1
      - n * m
      - next power of 2
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Convolution of lengths n and m yields n+m-1 terms.

  - question: Why must the sequences be padded to a power of two?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Because NTT works only on even lengths
      - Because iterative NTT assumes length is a power of two
      - Because the modulus requires it for correctness
      - Because the output length is a power of two
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Radix-2 NTT implementations require power-of-two length.
