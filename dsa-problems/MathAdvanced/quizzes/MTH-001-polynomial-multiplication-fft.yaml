questions:
  - question: What is the length of the output coefficient array?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - max(n, m)
      - n + m - 1
      - n * m
      - next power of 2
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The product degree is (n-1)+(m-1), so there are n+m-1 coefficients.

  - question: What modulus is used for the output coefficients?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "998244353"
      - "1000000007"
      - "1000000009"
      - "1000003"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The problem specifies output modulo 1,000,000,007.

  - question: Why are arrays padded to the next power of two before FFT?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - To reduce precision errors
      - Because radix-2 FFT requires power-of-two length
      - To avoid modular arithmetic
      - To make the result length n+m-1
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Standard FFT implementations assume lengths that are powers of two.
