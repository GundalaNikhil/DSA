  - question: After Gaussian elimination, how is the determinant computed?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Sum of diagonal
      - Product of diagonal times (-1)^{swaps}
      - Product of first row
      - Product of last column
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Upper triangular determinant is the product of diagonal entries with sign from swaps.
