  - question: What is the time complexity of Berlekamp-Massey itself?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(m)
      - O(m^2)
      - O(m log m)
      - O(log m)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: BM runs in O(m^2) over the provided terms.

  - question: Why do we need a separate method after BM to compute a_n for large n?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - BM does not return coefficients
      - BM only gives the recurrence, so we need fast exponentiation to reach n
      - BM is probabilistic
      - BM only works for even n
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: BM yields the recurrence; we still need fast exponentiation or linear rec to compute term n.
