  - question: What is the Vandermonde matrix definition used here?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - V[i][j] = x_i + j
      - V[i][j] = x_i^j
      - V[i][j] = x_j^i
      - V[i][j] = i^j
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A Vandermonde matrix has entries x_i^j.

  - question: Why must all x_i be distinct?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - To make the matrix symmetric
      - To ensure the Vandermonde matrix is invertible
      - To reduce time complexity
      - To avoid negative values
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Distinct x_i give a non-zero determinant, so the matrix is invertible.

  - question: For x=[1,2], what is the inverse Vandermonde matrix mod 1e9+7?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - 2 1000000006; 1000000006 1
      - 1 0; 0 1
      - 2 1; 1 2
      - 1 1000000006; 1000000006 2
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The example shows [[2,-1],[-1,1]] which is [2,1e9+6;1e9+6,1].

  - question: What is the typical time complexity for fast inversion here?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(n)
      - O(n^2)
      - O(n^3)
      - O(n log n)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The notes indicate O(n^2) with fast methods.
