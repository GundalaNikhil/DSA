  - question: Which expression estimates the eigenvalue from a vector v?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - v^T A v (Rayleigh quotient)
      - A v / v
      - det(A)
      - trace(A)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The Rayleigh quotient v^T A v is used to estimate lambda.

  - question: What can slow convergence of the power method?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Large eigenvalue gap
      - Small eigenvalue gap
      - Diagonal matrices
      - Symmetric matrices
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: If the top two eigenvalues are close, convergence is slow.
