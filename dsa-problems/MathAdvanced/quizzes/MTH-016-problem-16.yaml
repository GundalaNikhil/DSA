    question: What is mu(n) if n contains a square factor (e.g., n=4 or n=12)?
    options:
      - "0"
      - "1"
      - "-1"
      - n
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: By definition, the Mobius function is 0 if n is not square-free.

    question: What is the relationship between mu(d) and Dirichlet convolution?
    options:
      - mu * 1 = epsilon (the identity function)
      - mu * 1 = n
      - mu * mu = 1
      - None
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The Mobius function is the Dirichlet inverse of the constant function 1.
