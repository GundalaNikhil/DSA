# Bike Repair Plates - Editorial

## Problem Summary

You have a stack of plates with given diameters. You remove them one by one from the top.
-   When a plate is removed, the plate immediately below it is "revealed".
-   If the revealed plate is **larger** than the plate just removed, the revealed plate is marked **unsafe**.
-   Condition: If `removed_plate < revealed_plate`, then `revealed_plate` is unsafe.
-   Example: `5 2 4` (Top is 5, then 2, then 4).
    -   Remove 5. Reveal 2. `5 < 2`? No. 2 is safe.
    -   Remove 2. Reveal 4. `2 < 4`? Yes. 4 is marked unsafe.


## Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 200000`
- `1 <= d[i] <= 10^9`
## Real-World Scenario

Imagine a **Bike Repair Shop**.
-   You have a stack of metal plates (shims or washers).
-   You take the top one off to use it.
-   If the one you just took off is **smaller** than the one underneath, the one underneath might have been "crushed" or "exposed" improperly by the smaller pressure point.
-   You need to flag these potentially damaged plates for inspection.

## Problem Exploration

### Key Observations

The input gives plates from "top to bottom" where `d[0]` is the top plate.
-   Remove `d[0]`. Reveal `d[1]`. Check if `d[0] < d[1]`. If true, `d[1]` is unsafe.
-   Remove `d[1]`. Reveal `d[2]`. Check if `d[1] < d[2]`. If true, `d[2]` is unsafe.
-   Continue this process for all plates.

This is a linear scan comparing adjacent elements `d[i]` and `d[i+1]`. The problem reduces to counting indices `i` where `d[i] < d[i+1]`.

### Edge Cases
-   `N=1`: No comparisons possible. Count 0.
-   Equal values: `5 5`. `5 < 5` is False. Safe.
-   Increasing sequence: `1 2 3`. Both `2` and `3` are unsafe. Count 2.
-   Decreasing sequence: `3 2 1`. All safe. Count 0.

## Approaches

### Approach 1: Linear Scan
-   Iterate `i` from `0` to `n-2`.
-   If `d[i] < d[i+1]`, count++.
-   Complexity: `O(N)` time, `O(1)` space.

## Implementations

### Java

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int countUnsafe(int[] d) {
        int unsafeCount = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < d.length - 1; i++) {
            if (d[i] < d[i+1]) {
                unsafeCount++;
            }
        }
        return unsafeCount;
    }
}
```

### Python

```python
def count_unsafe(d: list[int]) -> int:
    unsafe_count = 0
    for i in range(len(d) - 1):
        if d[i] < d[i+1]:
            unsafe_count += 1
    return unsafe_count


def main():
    import sys
    input_data = sys.stdin.read().strip()
    if not input_data:
        return

    # TODO: Parse input and call solution
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### C++

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countUnsafe(const vector<int>& d) {
        int unsafeCount = 0;
        for (size_t i = 0; i < d.size() - 1; ++i) {
            if (d[i] < d[i+1]) {
                unsafeCount++;
            }
        }
        return unsafeCount;
    }
};
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
class Solution {
  countUnsafe(d) {
    let unsafeCount = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < d.length - 1; i++) {
      if (d[i] < d[i+1]) {
        unsafeCount++;
      }
    }
    return unsafeCount;
  }
}
```

## 🧪 Test Case Walkthrough (Dry Run)
**Input:** `5 2 4`

1.  `i=0`: `d[0]=5`, `d[1]=2`. `5 < 2` is False.
2.  `i=1`: `d[1]=2`, `d[2]=4`. `2 < 4` is True. Count = 1.
3.  End. Result 1.

## Proof of Correctness

-   **Simulation**: The code directly simulates the condition described: comparing the currently removed plate `d[i]` with the newly revealed plate `d[i+1]`.
-   **Completeness**: It checks every transition in the stack removal process.

## Interview Extensions

1.  **Recursive Removal**: What if unsafe plates are immediately discarded (shattered) and reveal the next one?
    -   *Hint*: This changes the problem significantly. Use a while loop or stack to handle cascading removals. Time complexity remains `O(N)`.
2.  **Previous Greater**: Find the first plate above that is larger.
    -   *Hint*: Use a Monotonic Stack.

### Common Mistakes

-   **Direction**: Confusing top-to-bottom with bottom-to-top.
-   **Strictness**: Using `<=` instead of `<`.
