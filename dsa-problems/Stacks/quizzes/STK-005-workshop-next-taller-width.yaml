    question: For heights [1, 7, 3, 4, 2] and width w=2, what is the 'next taller' for index 2 (height 3)?
    options:
      - "7"
      - "4"
      - "-1"
      - "2"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: At index 2, height is 3. Index 3 has height 4 (which is taller) and the distance is 1 (<= w=2).

    question: Which data structure is most efficient for finding the 'next greater' element in an array?
    options:
      - Max-heap
      - Queue
      - Monotonic stack
      - Linked list
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: A monotonic stack allows us to find the next greater element in O(1) amortized time per element.

    question: In this specific problem, how should the width constraint 'w' be handled using a monotonic stack?
    options:
      - Only push elements that are close to each other
      - When popping to find an answer for index i, check if |i - stack_top| <= w
      - Use a sliding window of size w with a priority queue
      - Restart the stack every w elements
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: When we encounter a taller element at index j, it can be the 'next taller' for index i only if j - i <= w.

    question: What is the time complexity to process N elements for a fixed width w?
    options:
      - O(N * w)
      - O(N log N)
      - O(N)
      - O(w log N)
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once, leading to O(N) complexity regardless of w.
