  - question: For stack [('a', 1)] and incoming ('a', 3), does deduplication happen?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Yes, because characters match
      - No, because 1+3=4 is even but stack is not empty after
      - No, because 1+3=4 is even (satisfies condition)
      - Depends on final stack state
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: "Both conditions must be TRUE: (1) characters match 'a'='a' ✓ AND (2) weight sum is even 1+3=4 even ✓. Both satisfied, so pair is removed."

  - question: For stack [('a', 1)] and incoming ('a', 2), does deduplication happen?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "Yes"
      - No, sum is odd
      - No, because 1+2=3 is odd
      - Yes, always when characters match
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Characters match but weight sum 1+2=3 is odd. Second condition fails. No removal.

  - question: What is the key difference between this problem and standard bracket matching?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Uses weights instead of just characters
      - Requires BOTH character match AND even weight sum, not just character match
      - Processes multiple elements at once
      - No difference; same concept
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Standard bracket matching: '(' and ')' are opposite types. Here: must match character AND weight must be even. Compound condition."

  - question: For sequence [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('a', 3)], what is the final stack?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - "[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('a', 3)] (no removals)"
      - "[('b', 2)] (first and last 'a' removed)"
      - "[('a', 1), ('b', 2)] (nothing removed from incoming)"
      - "[('a', 4), ('b', 2)] (weights summed)"
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: "Process: Push ('a', 1), push ('b', 2). On ('a', 3): top is ('b', 2), chars don't match 'a'!='b', no removal. Push ('a', 3). Final: [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('a', 3)]."
