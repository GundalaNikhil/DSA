  - question: After operations PUSH 5, PUSH 10, POP, what is TOP?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "10"
      - "5"
      - Empty
      - Error
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "LIFO order: Push 5 (stack=[5]), push 10 (stack=[5,10]), pop removes 10 (stack=[5]). TOP returns 5."

  - question: What does LIFO in stack mean?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Last In, First Out
      - Latest Information First Only
      - Linear Input Flow Order
      - Linked List For Output
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: LIFO (Last In, First Out) is the fundamental property of stacks. Most recently added elements are removed first.

  - question: For an undo system, why is LIFO appropriate?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - It's always faster
      - Most recent actions should be undone first, matching user expectations
      - It requires less memory
      - No particular reason; FIFO works equally well
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Users expect undo to reverse the most recent action. LIFO matches this natural expectation perfectly.

  - question: What is the time complexity for all stack operations (PUSH, POP, TOP) on a well-implemented stack?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(1) for PUSH, O(n) for POP
      - O(log n) for all
      - O(1) for all operations
      - O(n) for all
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: "Stacks with array/linked list backing provide O(1) time for all basic operations: PUSH adds to top, POP removes from top, TOP accesses top."
