    question: If an element is pushed at t=2 and popped at t=6, and its window constraint W is 2, is it valid?
    options:
      - "Yes"
      - "No"
      - Only if it is priority
      - Depends on pop order
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Popping at t=6 is 4 time units after t=2, which exceeds the allowed window W=2.

    question: In standard stack behavior, which pop sequence is valid for push sequence [1, 2, 3]?
    options:
      - 3 1 2
      - 3 2 1
      - 1 3 2
      - Both 3 2 1 and 1 3 2
    correct_answer: 3
    explanation: 3 2 1 is valid (push 1, 2, 3 then pop all). 1 3 2 is valid (push 1, pop 1, push 2, 3 then pop 3, 2). 3 1 2 is invalid.

    question: What does the 'priority' constraint require?
    options:
      - Priority elements must be pushed first
      - Priority elements must be popped before any larger non-priority element
      - Priority elements are never popped
      - Priority elements must be popped at t=0
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: This is a custom constraint specified in the problem statement regarding priority elements.

    question: What is the time complexity of validating all N-element sequences and M constraints?
    options:
      - O(N + M)
      - O(N * M)
      - O(N log N)
      - O(1)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: A single simulation pass over the sequences checking constraints as they occur results in O(N + M) time.
