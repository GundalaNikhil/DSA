    question: For the input [2, 9, 5, 7, 3], what is the result for the element 5?
    options:
      - "2"
      - "9"
      - "-1"
      - "7"
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: 5 is odd. We need the nearest element to its left that is greater and even. 2 is even and to the left, but 9 is greater and closer (but odd). 2 is the ONLY even number to the left.

    question: Why is it beneficial to maintain two separate monotonic stacks (one for odd, one for even) for this problem?
    options:
      - To reduce memory usage
      - To simplify searching for opposite parity without checking every element
      - Because the problem requires sorted input
      - To avoid using an array
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: When processing an even number, we can look at the 'odd' stack to find the nearest greater element without being blocked by other even numbers.

    question: When should an element be popped from the parity-specific monotonic stack?
    options:
      - When the current element is smaller than the stack top
      - When the current element is strictly greater than the stack top
      - When the parity matches the current element's parity
      - After every 10 indices
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: In a monotonic decreasing stack, we pop smaller elements because the current taller element is a 'better' previous greater candidate for future elements.

    question: What is the total space complexity if we store two monotonic stacks?
    options:
      - O(1)
      - O(N)
      - O(N^2)
      - O(log N)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The total number of elements across both stacks can never exceed N, so the space complexity is O(N).
