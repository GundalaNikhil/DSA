  - question: For string '?()', how should the wildcard be assigned to validate?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - "? = '(' making '(()' (invalid)"
      - "? = ')' making ')()' (invalid)"
      - "? = '(' making '(())' OR '?' cannot make it valid"
      - Cannot be determined
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: "'?' at position 0 must pair with something. If '?'='(', we get '(()' with outer pair. Actually: '()()' vs '(())'. '?=' '(' gives '(()' (3 chars, needs pairing). Let me recalculate: string is '?()', positions 0,1,2. If '?'='(': '(()' needs closing. If '?'=')', '())' has unmatched '('. Neither works perfectly. This string may be invalid."

  - question: For string 'a(b)c' with no wildcards, what does the algorithm do?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Treats 'a', 'b', 'c' as wildcards
      - Ignores non-bracket characters and validates '()' only
      - Fails because non-bracket characters exist
      - Replaces non-bracket chars with '?'
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Only brackets (and wildcards) matter for validation. Other characters are ignored. String '()' is valid.
