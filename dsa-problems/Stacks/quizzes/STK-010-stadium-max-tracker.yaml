    question: If the stack operations are PUSH 2, PUSH 9, PUSH 5, what does GETMAX return?
    options:
      - "2"
      - "5"
      - "9"
      - EMPTY
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: The current elements are {2, 9, 5}. The maximum is 9.

    question: Which data structure is most commonly used to implement a max-stack with O(1) complexity for all operations?
    options:
      - Priority Queue
      - An auxiliary stack that stores the maximum seen so far at each level
      - A balanced BST
      - A deque
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The auxiliary stack mirrors the main stack but holds the 'current max' at that stack height.

    question: If you POP an element that is NOT the current maximum, what happens to the result of GETMAX?
    options:
      - It decreases
      - It remains the same
      - It must be recalculated linearly
      - The stack becomes empty
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The maximum only potentially changes when the current maximum element itself is removed from the stack.

    question: What is the output of POP followed by TOP on an empty stack?
    options:
      - EMPTY EMPTY
      - ERROR ERROR
      - -1 -1
      - 0 0
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The problem specifies outputting EMPTY for both operations if the stack is empty.
