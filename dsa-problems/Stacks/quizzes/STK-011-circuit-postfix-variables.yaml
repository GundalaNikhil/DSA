    question: What does the 'DUP' operation do in stack-based evaluation?
    options:
      - Delete the top element
      - Double the top element's value
      - Push a copy of the current top element onto the stack
      - Swap the top two
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: DUP stands for duplicate, creating a second copy of the top element on the stack.

    question: How should modulo operations be handled to prevent overflow with 64-bit integers and a MOD of 10^9 + 7?
    options:
      - Only modulo the final result
      - Apply modulo after every addition and multiplication
      - Apply modulo only after multiplication
      - Don't use modulo until it exceeds 2^63
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Applying modulo frequently prevents numbers from growing too large and potentially overflowing even 64-bit containers.

    question: If a variable 'x' is in the expression but not provided in the variable map, what should the program do?
    options:
      - Assume x = 0
      - Stop with an error
      - Ignore the token
      - Skip the variable
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: In a real implementation, missing variables should be treated as errors, though this specific problem often assumes a valid map.
