    question: If a stack contains [5, 1, 3] (top is 3), what is the output of MIN 2?
    options:
      - "5"
      - "1"
      - "3"
      - NA
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The top 2 elements are {1, 3}. The minimum is 1.

    question: To answer 'MIN k' in constant time for a stack, what do we typically store alongside the main values?
    options:
      - A sorted list of all elements
      - A min-heap
      - A second stack (or prefix-min array) storing the minimum of elements up to that point
      - A queue
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: A min-stack or prefix-min array stores the minimum of all elements from the bottom up to the current index.

    question: When should the command 'MIN k' output 'NA'?
    options:
      - If k is negative
      - If the current stack size is less than k
      - If the stack is empty
      - If k is greater than the total pushes
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The problem specifies output NA if fewer than k elements exist in the stack.

    question: What is the amortized time complexity of the PUSH and MIN operations in an optimized implementation?
    options:
      - O(1)
      - O(log N)
      - O(k)
      - O(N)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: By updating metadata (like a min-stack) during PUSH, both operations can be completed in O(1).
