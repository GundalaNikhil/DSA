    question: With prices [3, 1, 4, 6, 5] and threshold t=2, how many steps must index 0 (price 3) wait?
    options:
      - "1"
      - "2"
      - "0"
      - "3"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The next price >= 3 + 2 (i.e., >= 5) is 6, at index 3. Distance 3-0 = 3? Wait, 4 is at index 2. 4 is not at least 2 higher than 3 (3+2=5). 6 is. Index 3 minus index 0 is 3? Let me re-read. Oh, example says 56 for 3, wait 2? Price 5 is at index 4? Wait. [3, 1, 4, 6, 5]. Index 2 is 4 (diff 1). Index 3 is 6 (diff 3). Index 4 is 5 (diff 2). Yes, at index 4 (dist 4). Wait, example says 2?

    question: In a monotonic stack approach for the 'next greater' variation, what do the stack elements typically represent?
    options:
      - The raw prices
      - The indices of prices that haven't found their matching threshold jump yet
      - The threshold values
      - The distance answers
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: We store indices to later calculate the distance (current_index - stored_index) once the condition is met.

    question: When processing price P[j], which elements should be popped from the stack if the stack contains indices 'i'?
    options:
      - All indices where P[j] - P[i] >= t
      - Only the top index
      - Only indices with lower parity
      - Elements with even values
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: If the current price provides a sufficient jump for index i, we resolve i's answer and remove it from the stack.

    question: If the prices are strictly decreasing [10, 8, 6, 4, 1] and t=1, what is the output?
    options:
      - 1 1 1 1 0
      - 0 0 0 0 0
      - 4 3 2 1 0
      - -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Since no price is higher than a previous price, no jump of at least t (positive) can ever be found.
