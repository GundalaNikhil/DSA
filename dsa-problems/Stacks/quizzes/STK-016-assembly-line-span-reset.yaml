    question: For counts [2, 1, 3, 2, 5], what is the span for the 3rd element (value 3)?
    options:
      - "1"
      - "2"
      - "3"
      - "0"
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: The span includes today (1) plus consecutive prior days strictly less than today. 3rd day is 3. Prior days are 2 and 1 (both < 3). So span is 3.

    question: If the input counts are [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], what are the spans?
    options:
      - 1 1 1 1 1
      - 1 2 3 4 5
      - 0 1 2 3 4
      - 5 4 3 2 1
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Each day's count is strictly greater than all previous days, so its span inclusive of itself is its index + 1.
