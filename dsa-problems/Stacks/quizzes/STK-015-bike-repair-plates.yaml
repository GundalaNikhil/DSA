    question: A stack of plates has diameters [5, 2, 4] from top to bottom. Which plate is marked unsafe?
    options:
      - "5"
      - "2"
      - "4"
      - None
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Index of 4? Plate with diameter 4 is revealed when 2 is removed. Since 2 < 4, the revealed plate (4) is unsafe.

    question: Under what condition is the next revealed plate marked unsafe?
    options:
      - If it is smaller than the plate removed above it
      - If it is larger than the plate removed above it
      - If it has the same size
      - Always
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "The problem states: 'If a plate is smaller than a plate beneath it at the moment that plate is revealed, the lower plate is marked unsafe.'"

    question: What is the time complexity of counting unsafe plates for a stack of size N?
    options:
      - O(N)
      - O(N^2)
      - O(log N)
      - O(1)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: A single linear scan through the plates (simulating the removal) takes O(N).

    question: How many plates can be marked unsafe in a stack of N elements?
    options:
      - Only 1
      - Up to N-1
      - Exactly N
      - "0"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Every plate except the top one can potentially be marked unsafe if it is larger than the plate immediately above it.
