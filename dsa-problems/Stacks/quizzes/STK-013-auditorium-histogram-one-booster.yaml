    question: In a histogram [2, 4, 2], if you boost one bar by at most b=3, what is the maximum area?
    options:
      - "6"
      - "7"
      - "8"
      - "10"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Boosting the middle bar (4) by 3 makes it 7. The rectangle with height 7 and width 1 has area 7. Boosting the side bars to 5 doesn't help more than area 6 (5*1) or 4 (2*3).

    question: What is the time complexity of the classic Largest Rectangle in Histogram problem using a monotonic stack?
    options:
      - O(N log N)
      - O(N)
      - O(N^2)
      - O(N log N)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The monotonic stack approach processes each bar twice (once pushed, once popped), resulting in O(N) complexity.

    question: How does the 'booster' constraint affect the area of a rectangle that includes the boosted bar?
    options:
      - It increases the minimum height of the entire rectangle
      - It only potentially increases the minimum height of rectangles where the boosted bar was the minimum
      - It doubles the total area
      - It has no effect
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A rectangle's height is determined by the shortest bar. Boosting a bar only helps if that bar was limiting the height of the rectangle.

    question: If all bars have height 10 and b=5, and n=3, what is the max area after one boost?
    options:
      - "30"
      - "35"
      - "45"
      - "15"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Boosting one 10 to 15 doesn't help the overall rectangle which still has min height 10 (area 3 * 10 = 30). The single bar itself has area 15. The max is 30.
