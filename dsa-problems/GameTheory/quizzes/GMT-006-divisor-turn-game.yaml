    question: "Which numbers are Losing positions?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Primes"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "Powers of primes"

      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Numbers with no proper divisors > 1"
        correct: true
    explanation: "Primes have no proper divisors > 1, so they are losing. Squares of primes (like 4) can move to the prime (2), which is losing, so squares are Winning."

    type: single_choice
    question: "Why is memoization useful here?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Because many numbers share the same divisors."
        correct: true
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "It isn't useful."
        correct: false
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "Because the recursion depth is infinite."
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "To sort the numbers."
        correct: false
    explanation: "Different paths can reach the same divisor (e.g., 12->6->2 and 12->4->2). Memoization avoids recomputing."

    type: scenario
    question: "You are at 12. You can move to 2, 3, 4, 6. Which move guarantees a win?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Move to 6"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"

      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Move to 3"
        correct: true
    explanation: "2 and 3 are primes (Losing). Moving to a Losing state makes you Win. 4 and 6 are Winning states (they can move to primes)."
