    type: single_choice
    question: "Why is the period L+1?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Because we can reach 0...L-1, but not L."
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "Because we can reach G values 0...L-1, but not L?"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "Because from L+1, we can reach 1...L+1 (values 0...L), so mex is 0?"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "From X, we can reach X-1...X-L. This window of size L repeats."
        correct: true
    explanation: "The set of reachable states shifts by 1 each step. The mex pattern repeats every L+1."
