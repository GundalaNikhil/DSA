    question: "What traversal method is best suited for this problem?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "BFS from start."
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "DFS with Memoization (or Reverse Topological Sort)."
        correct: true

        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Union-Find."
        correct: false
    explanation: "We need to determine the value of a node based on its successors. DFS with memoization or processing in reverse topological order works efficiently."

    question: "In a graph 0->1, 0->2, 1->3, 2->3. Node 3 is terminal. What is the status of Node 0?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Winning"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"

        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Unknown"
        correct: false
    explanation: "3 is L. 1->3(L) so 1 is W. 2->3(L) so 2 is W. 0->1(W) and 0->2(W). Since all moves lead to W, 0 is L."

        text: "Because the input guarantees a DAG."
        correct: true
