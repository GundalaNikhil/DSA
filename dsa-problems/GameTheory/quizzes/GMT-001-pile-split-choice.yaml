    question: "Which of the following splits is valid for a pile of size 8?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "(4, 4)"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "(0, 8)"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "(3, 5)"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "(2, 2, 4)"
        correct: false
    explanation: "The split must be into TWO non-empty piles of DIFFERENT sizes. (4,4) are equal. (0,8) has an empty pile. (2,2,4) is three piles. (3,5) is valid."

    type: single_choice
    question: "If n=2, who wins?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "First"

        text: "Depends"
        correct: false
    explanation: "For n=2, the only possible split is (1, 1), which is invalid because sizes must be different. So First player has no moves."

    type: single_choice
    question: "Is the game guaranteed to end?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"

    type: single_choice
    question: "Why do we use XOR sum?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Because it's faster than addition."
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "Because the game splits into independent subgames."
        correct: true
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "To check parity."
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "It is arbitrary."
        correct: false
    explanation: "The Sprague-Grundy theorem states that the Grundy value of a composite game (sum of games) is the XOR sum of the Grundy values of its components."

    question: "You have two piles of sizes 4 and 5. Who wins?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "First player."
        correct: true

        text: "Cannot determine."
        correct: false
    explanation: "G(4)=0, G(5)=2. XOR sum = 0 ^ 2 = 2. Since 2 > 0, it is a winning state for the First player."
