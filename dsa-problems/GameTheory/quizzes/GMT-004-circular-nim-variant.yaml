    question: "What happens to the total number of stones in a move where you remove 1 stone?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Decreases by 1."
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "Increases by 1."
        correct: true
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "Stays the same."

    question: "Which of these are valid moves from [2, 0, 0]?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Remove 1 from index 0 -> [1, 1, 1]"
        correct: true

    type: single_choice
    question: "Why do we use a 'visiting' set in the recursion?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "To optimize memory."
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "To detect cycles."
        correct: true
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "To store the result."
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "To count steps."
        correct: false
    explanation: "The 'visiting' set tracks the current recursion path. If we see a state already in 'visiting', we found a cycle."

    type: single_choice
    question: "If a state can reach both WIN and DRAW, what is its value?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "WIN"
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"

        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Depends on whose turn it is."
        correct: false
    explanation: "Wait, if a state can reach a LOSS (for opponent), it is WIN. If it can reach DRAW but not LOSS, it is DRAW. So if it can reach both LOSS (Win) and DRAW, it is WIN because the player will choose the move to LOSS."

    question: "Why is memoization effective here?"
