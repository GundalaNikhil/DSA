    type: single_choice
    question: "Why is G(n) = n-1?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Because we can reach all values 0 to n-2."
        correct: true
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "Because we can reach n-1."
        correct: false

        text: "It's a guess."
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Because split moves don't matter."
        correct: false
    explanation: "The set of reachable values is {0, 1, ..., n-2} plus some split values. The mex is n-1."

    question: "Does the split move allow reaching higher Grundy values?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Yes, potentially."
        correct: true
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "No, split always reduces value."
        correct: false
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "Only for even n."
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Never."
        correct: false
    explanation: "Splitting 3 (G=2) into 1+2 (G=0^1=1) reduces. Splitting 7 (G=6) into 3+4 (G=2^3=1) reduces. But theoretically, XOR sum could be larger than n-1? Actually, for G(n)=n-1, (a-1)^(b-1) < a+b-2 < n-1 is not guaranteed, but usually smaller."

    question: "If we couldn't split, what would G(n) be?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "n - 1"
        correct: true
      - option_id: "B"

        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "1"
        correct: false
    explanation: "If we only remove k items (reaching 1..n-1), then G(n) = mex(G(1)..G(n-1)). G(1)=0. G(2)=mex(0)=1. G(3)=mex(0,1)=2. Still n-1."
