  - question: If you split a heap of size 4 into 2 and 2, what is the new Grundy value?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - G(2) + G(2)
      - G(2) ^ G(2)
      - max(G(2), G(2))
      - G(4)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Splitting creates two independent subgames. The value is the XOR sum of their values.

  - question: Which moves are valid for a heap of size 3?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Remove 1 -> Size 2
      - Remove 2 -> Size 1
      - Split into 1 and 2
      - Remove 3 -> Size 0
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Cannot reduce to 0. Can remove 1 or 2. Can split into 1+2.

  - question: What is the pattern for G(n)?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - G(n) = n
      - G(n) = n - 1
      - G(n) = n / 2
      - G(n) = n % 2
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: G(n) = n - 1 matches the reachable states.
