    question: "Why do we use a boolean DP instead of Grundy numbers?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Grundy numbers are wrong here."
        correct: false
      - option_id: "B"
        text: "We only need to know Win/Loss, not the exact Grundy value."
        correct: true
      - option_id: "C"
        text: "Boolean DP is slower."
        correct: false
      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Grundy numbers don't work with banned sets."
        correct: false
    explanation: "Since it's a single pile game, we just need to know if it's a P-position or N-position. Grundy numbers are needed for sums of games (multiple piles)."

    question: "How do we efficiently check if a square is banned?"
    options:
      - option_id: "A"
        text: "Iterate through the array B every time."
        correct: false

      - option_id: "D"
        text: "Both B and C are efficient."
        correct: true
    explanation: "Hash Set gives O(1) lookup. Binary search gives O(log K). Both are efficient enough given K is small."
