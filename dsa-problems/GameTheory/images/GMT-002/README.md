# Image Generation Prompts for GMT-002: Token Walk on Directed Graph

## Required Images

### 1. problem-illustration.png

**Purpose:** Main visual of problem concept

**Generation Prompt:**
```
Create a technical diagram showing a Token on a DAG:
- Display a graph with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 and directed edges.
- Show a "Token" (coin-like object) on Node 0.
- Arrows indicating possible moves from 0 to 1 and 0 to 2.
- Clean, professional style with blue/gray tones.
- Size: 1200x800px
```

### 2. real-world-scenario.png

**Purpose:** Real-world application visualization

**Generation Prompt:**
```
Illustrate the Project Dependency Game:
- Context: A whiteboard with a flowchart of tasks.
- Elements: Two people pointing at tasks.
- Visual metaphor: "Following the arrows until the end".
- Modern professional style.
- Size: 1200x800px
```

### 3. algorithm-visualization.png

**Purpose:** Algorithm flow diagram

**Generation Prompt:**
```
Create flowchart showing Winning/Losing Propagation:
- Bottom nodes (Terminal) colored Red (Losing).
- Nodes pointing to Red nodes colored Green (Winning).
- Nodes pointing ONLY to Green nodes colored Red (Losing).
- Arrows showing the flow of logic (backwards from terminal).
- Size: 1600x900px
```

### 4. example-1.png

**Purpose:** Example walkthrough

**Generation Prompt:**
```
Visualize the example 0->1->2:
- Node 2: Red (Losing) - "No Moves".
- Node 1: Green (Winning) - "Move to 2".
- Node 0: Red (Losing) - "Must move to 1 (Winning)".
- Size: 1200x800px
```
