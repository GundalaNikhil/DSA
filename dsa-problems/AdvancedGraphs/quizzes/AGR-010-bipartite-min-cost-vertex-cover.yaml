  - question: What is a vertex cover in a graph?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - A set of edges covering all vertices
      - A set of vertices such that every edge is incident to at least one vertex
      - A path covering all vertices
      - A subgraph with all vertices
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A vertex cover is a minimal set of nodes such that every edge has at least one endpoint in the set. Minimum vertex cover minimizes the set size.

  - question: In minimum cost vertex cover, what is cost?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Number of vertices selected
      - Sum of edge weights
      - Sum of weights of selected vertices
      - Maximum weight in the set
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Each vertex has a cost/weight. The cover cost is the sum of weights of all selected vertices.

  - question: How is minimum cost vertex cover in bipartite graphs solved?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Greedy selection by cost
      - Min-Cut/Max-Flow theorem on a constructed network
      - Dynamic programming
      - Brute force enumeration
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Construct flow network: source→left (capacity=cost), right→sink (capacity=cost), left↔right (infinite capacity). Min-cut value = min vertex cover cost."

  - question: In the min vertex cover flow network, why are edges L↔R assigned infinite capacity?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - To ensure connectivity
      - Because we don't want to cut them; they separate the S and T sides of the cut
      - To simplify computation
      - Standard convention
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A cut in the flow network partitions nodes into S-side and T-side. Infinite capacity ensures edges between L and R never contribute to min-cut. Only edges from source and to sink matter.
