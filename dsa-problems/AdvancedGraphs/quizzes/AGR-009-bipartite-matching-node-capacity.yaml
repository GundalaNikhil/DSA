  - question: In maximum bipartite matching with node capacities, what does node capacity mean?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Maximum degree of the node
      - Maximum flow that can pass through the node
      - Maximum matching pairs involving the node
      - Node weight
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Node capacity limits how many edges can use that node. For demand/supply, it's how many items that node can handle.

  - question: How is maximum bipartite matching with node capacities solved using max flow?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Add source to left nodes, right nodes to sink with capacities
      - Use standard max flow with edge capacities only
      - Preprocess node capacities as min degree
      - Use greedy matching
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "Create a flow network: source→left (capacity = left's demand), left↔right (edges with capacity 1), right→sink (capacity = right's supply)."

  - question: In the matching network, why is edge capacity between left and right = 1?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Bipartite graphs have unit edges
      - Each edge can be used at most once (one pair per original edge)
      - To simplify computation
      - Standard convention
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: In matching, each original edge (u,v) can match at most one pair. Flow of 1 on an edge means it's matched; flow of 0 means unmatched.

  - question: For a bipartite graph with left partition demand [2, 1, 3] and right partition supply [2, 2, 2], is a perfect matching possible?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Yes, always possible
      - Yes, total demand 6 = total supply 6
      - No, imbalanced
      - Depends on edges
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: If total demand = total supply, a matching exists iff Hall's condition is met (connectivity-based). Equality is necessary but not sufficient.
