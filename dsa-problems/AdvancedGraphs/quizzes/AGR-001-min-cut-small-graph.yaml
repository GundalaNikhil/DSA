  - question: In the Stoer-Wagner algorithm, what is the 'Maximum Adjacency Search' phase trying to find?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - The node with the most edges
      - The node most tightly connected to the current set
      - The node with the highest degree
      - The node furthest from the source
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Maximum Adjacency Search greedily adds the node with the highest total weight of edges connecting to the already-selected set, gradually growing the set of nodes.

  - question: Which of the following are true about the cut-of-the-phase in Stoer-Wagner? (Select all that apply)
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - It is the total weight of edges connecting the last added node to the rest
      - It represents a valid s-t cut in the current graph
      - It is always the global minimum cut
      - It must be updated after merging nodes
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The cut-of-the-phase is the weight of edges from the last node (t) to all others, which forms a valid specific s-t cut. However, it may not be the global minimum (we track the minimum over all phases). The cut-of-the-phase is computed before merging, not after.

  - question: Why does Stoer-Wagner use node merging instead of just running max-flow for all node pairs?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - It's simpler to implement
      - It avoids the quadratic overhead of running max-flow N times
      - It guarantees a faster algorithm
      - It works for disconnected graphs
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Running max-flow N times gives O(N * V^2 * E) complexity, which is worse than Stoer-Wagner's O(N^3) for dense graphs. Merging reduces the problem size efficiently.

  - question: In a star graph where the center has 5 leaf nodes connected with weights 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, what is the minimum cut?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - "15"
      - "1"
      - "5"
      - "10"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: In a star graph, any cut separating the center from the leaves must cut at least one edge. The minimum is cutting the single edge with the smallest weight, which is 1.
