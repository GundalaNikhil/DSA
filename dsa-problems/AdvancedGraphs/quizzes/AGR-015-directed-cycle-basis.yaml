  - question: What is a cycle basis in a directed graph?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - A set of all cycles
      - A minimal set of independent cycles spanning the cycle space
      - The fundamental cycles in the DFS tree
      - Cycles with minimum length
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A cycle basis is a minimal set where linear combinations (XOR over edges) can generate any cycle in the graph. Size = m - n + c (for undirected; directed is similar).

  - question: How many cycles are in a cycle basis for a directed graph with V nodes, E edges, and C connected components?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - E
      - V
      - C
      - E - V + C
    correct_answer: 3
    explanation: Cycle Rank (basis size) = E - V + C. This is the dimension of the cycle space (number of independent cycles needed to span all cycles).

  - question: In the cycle basis algorithm, what is the first step?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Find all cycles
      - For each edge not in DFS tree, find shortest path (in reverse)
      - Build DFS tree
      - Compute edge indices
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Build a DFS tree first. Then, for each non-tree edge, find a path to close a cycle. This cycle is candidate for the basis.

  - question: How are cycles represented in the cycle basis?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Adjacency lists
      - Bitmasks (each bit = edge)
      - Edge lists
      - Cycle objects
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Bitmasks efficiently represent cycles. Each edge gets a bit index. XOR of two cycles = symmetric difference (useful for Gaussian Elimination).
