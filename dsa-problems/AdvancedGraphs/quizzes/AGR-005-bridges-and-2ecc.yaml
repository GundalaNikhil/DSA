  - question: What is a bridge in an undirected graph?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - An edge connecting two components
      - An edge whose removal disconnects the graph or increases components
      - The longest edge
      - An edge in a cycle
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "A bridge is a critical edge. Removing it increases the number of connected components. Examples: edges in a tree are all bridges, edges in a cycle are not bridges."

  - question: "In Tarjan's bridge-finding algorithm, a bridge is detected when:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - low[v] < tin[u]
      - low[v] > tin[u]
      - low[v] == tin[v]
      - dfs_parent[v] == u
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: If low[v] > tin[u], then v cannot reach any ancestor of u via back-edges. So (u,v) is a bridge. The condition means v's subtree has no back-edge to u or its ancestors.

  - question: In a tree with N nodes, how many bridges exist?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - "0"
      - "1"
      - N-1
      - Depends on structure
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: Every edge in a tree is a bridge. A tree has exactly N-1 edges, so all N-1 edges are bridges. Removing any edge disconnects the tree.

  - question: What is a 2-edge-connected component?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - A component with at least 2 edges
      - A subgraph where any two nodes have 2 edge-disjoint paths
      - A component reachable via 2 edges
      - A component with 2 nodes
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: A 2-edge-connected component (2ECC) is a maximal subgraph where every pair of vertices has at least 2 edge-disjoint paths. Equivalently, no bridges exist within the 2ECC.
