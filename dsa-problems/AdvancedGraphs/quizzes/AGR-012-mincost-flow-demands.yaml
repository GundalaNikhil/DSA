  - question: In min-cost max-flow with demands, what does a node demand represent?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Maximum flow the node can accept
      - Exact flow that must pass through/originate at the node
      - Cost of processing flow
      - Node capacity
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Demand (supply/source node) must output exactly that amount. Demand (sink node) must input exactly that amount. Flow conservation becomes: outflow - inflow = supply[node]."

  - question: What is the first step in solving MCMF with lower bounds on edges?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Run standard MCMF
      - Add super-source and super-sink
      - Transform lower bounds into demands
      - Compute minimum cost directly
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: "For each edge [L, H, cost]: pre-push L units of flow (add L to cost), adjust node supplies by ±L, adjust edge capacity to H-L with residual edge [0, 0, -cost]."

  - question: After transforming lower bounds, what is the new supply/demand balance condition?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Total supply = total demand
      - All supplies and demands = 0
      - Supply and demand are preserved from original
      - Automatically balanced by transformation
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Transformation ensures feasibility. For problem to be solvable, sum of all demands must equal sum of all supplies (else infeasible).

  - question: In MCMF with demands, which algorithm is typically used?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Successive Shortest Paths (SSP)
      - Cycle Canceling
      - Min-Cost Flow with initial SPFA
      - Standard Dinic's
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: SSP or Cycle Canceling can work. SSP requires SPFA initialization (for negative costs from lower bound transformation). Then Dijkstra with potentials.
