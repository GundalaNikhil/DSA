  - question: What is capacity scaling in Dinic's algorithm?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Reducing graph size
      - Processing flows from largest to smallest capacities
      - Scaling costs, not capacities
      - Running multiple Dinic iterations
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Start with delta = largest power of 2 ≤ max capacity. Only consider edges with residual ≥ delta. Halve delta repeatedly until delta = 1.

  - question: Why does capacity scaling reduce the number of augmentations?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - It's a greedy approach
      - Each augmentation pushes at least delta flow, reducing total augmentations
      - It skips small edges
      - Improves BFS efficiency
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "If each augmentation pushes >= delta, and total flow is F, then # augmentations <= F/delta. Summing over all delta values: O(log C) phases with O(E) augmentations each."

  - question: For max capacity C, how many delta phases are there?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - C phases
      - log₂(C) phases
      - √C phases
      - 1 phase
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Start with delta = 2^⌊log₂C⌋, then halve: delta = 2^(k-1), 2^(k-2), ..., 1. Total: k+1 phases where k = ⌊log₂C⌋."

  - question: What is the time complexity of Dinic with scaling?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(V²E)
      - O(V²E log C)
      - O(VE log C)
      - O(E log V log C)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Dinic: O(V²E) base. With scaling: O(log C) phases, each O(V²E). Total: O(V²E log C)."
