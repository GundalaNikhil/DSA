  - question: What is a Strongly Connected Component (SCC)?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - A set of nodes reachable from one node
      - A maximal set of nodes where every node can reach every other node
      - A set of nodes with equal in-degree
      - A cycle in the graph
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: An SCC is a maximal subgraph with the property that for any two nodes u and v, there's a path u→v and v→u. Equivalently, they're part of a cycle together.

  - question: "In Tarjan's SCC algorithm, a node u is the root of an SCC when:"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - tin[u] = 0
      - low[u] == tin[u]
      - u has no incoming edges
      - u is visited first in DFS
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: When low[u] == tin[u], node u cannot reach any ancestor. This marks u as SCC root. All nodes on stack above u form that SCC.

  - question: For a DAG (directed acyclic graph), how many SCCs exist?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - 1 (the whole graph)
      - V (one per node)
      - Depends on structure
      - "0"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "DAGs have no cycles, so no node can reach back to others. Each node is its own SCC. Total: V SCCs (singletons)."

  - question: What is the condensation graph?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - A graph with compressed nodes (each node is an SCC)
      - The shortest path between SCCs
      - A tree of SCCs
      - The complement graph
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The condensation graph contracts each SCC into a single node. Edges between nodes represent edges between original SCCs. It's always a DAG.
