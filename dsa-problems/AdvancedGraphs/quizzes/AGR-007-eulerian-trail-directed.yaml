  - question: What is an Eulerian path?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - A path visiting all nodes exactly once
      - A path traversing all edges exactly once
      - The shortest path between two nodes
      - A cycle that visits all edges
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: An Eulerian path (or trail) traverses every edge exactly once. It may visit nodes multiple times. An Eulerian circuit is a closed Eulerian path.

  - question: For a directed graph to have an Eulerian circuit, which conditions must hold? (Select all that apply)
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Every node has in-degree = out-degree
      - The graph must be connected (weakly or strongly)
      - At least one node must have positive in-degree
      - No node can have degree 0
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "For Eulerian circuit: in-degree = out-degree for all nodes, and graph connectivity ensures all edges are reachable. Weakly connected is sufficient (one component)."

  - question: For a directed graph to have an Eulerian trail (not circuit), what is the degree condition?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - All nodes have in-degree = out-degree
      - "One node: out-degree = in-degree + 1 (start). One node: in-degree = out-degree + 1 (end). Others balanced."
      - Out-degree > in-degree everywhere
      - All degrees must be even
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Trail starts at a node with excess out-degree (+1) and ends at a node with excess in-degree (+1). All other nodes are balanced.

  - question: What is Hierholzer's algorithm?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - A greedy algorithm for shortest path
      - A DFS-based algorithm that finds Eulerian paths by backtracking
      - A preprocessing step for graph coloring
      - A network flow algorithm
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Hierholzer's uses a stack to traverse edges until stuck, then backtracks and builds the path in reverse. Time: O(E) with proper edge removal."
