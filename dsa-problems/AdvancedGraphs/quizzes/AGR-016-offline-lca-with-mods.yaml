questions:
  - question: What is Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - The node closest to the root
      - The deepest node both u and v can reach
      - The deepest node that is an ancestor of both u and v
      - The root of the tree
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: LCA(u,v) is the node furthest from root that has both u and v in its subtree (or is u/v itself if one is ancestor of other).

  - question: What does 'offline' mean in LCA queries?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - No internet connection
      - Queries are known in advance (not interactive)
      - Graph is static
      - Cannot use precomputation
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Offline LCA: all queries are given upfront. Enables preprocessing to answer them efficiently (vs. online where queries come one at a time)."

  - question: In offline LCA with edge modifications, what is a modification?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Changing node values
      - Adding/removing edges from the tree
      - Reordering nodes
      - Changing edge weights
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Modifications change tree topology: add edge (creating cycle; process as union/merge), or remove edge (delete connectivity). LCA queries must reflect current tree state."

  - question: In offline LCA with modifications, what is the main algorithm?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Standard LCA preprocessing
      - Map edges to time intervals; use DFS + DSU rollback
      - Run Dijkstra multiple times
      - Dynamic programming
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Process modifications in order, assigning time intervals. DFS with Disjoint Set Union (DSU) with rollback maintains connectivity at each time point.
