  - question: What does 'loopless' mean in the context of K shortest paths?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Paths must not visit the same edge twice
      - Paths must not visit the same vertex twice
      - Paths must be directed
      - Paths must avoid cycles
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Loopless means simple paths where no vertex is visited more than once. This prevents cycles and ensures each path is a distinct route from source to target.

  - question: In Yen's algorithm, which statements are true? (Select all that apply)
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - It finds the shortest path first using Dijkstra
      - It explores deviations by trying different 'spur nodes'
      - It requires running Dijkstra multiple times
      - It guarantees finding all simple paths
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Yen's starts with Dijkstra for P_1. For each new path, it systematically tries deviating at each node in the previous path. Dijkstra runs K times (once for each candidate). It doesn't guarantee all paths, just the K shortest.

  - question: What is the 'root path' in Yen's algorithm?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - The shortest path from source to any node
      - The path from source to the spur node, fixed from a previous solution
      - The longest simple path
      - The path with minimum vertex count
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The root path is the prefix shared with a previous K-th shortest path, from source to the spur node. This anchors the deviation search.

  - question: Why are nodes in the root path (except spur node) marked as 'forbidden' in Yen's?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - To reduce search space
      - To prevent cycles and ensure simple paths
      - To speed up Dijkstra
      - To avoid redundant paths
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Marking root path nodes as forbidden prevents the spur path from revisiting them, ensuring the resulting path has no repeated vertices (simple path property).
