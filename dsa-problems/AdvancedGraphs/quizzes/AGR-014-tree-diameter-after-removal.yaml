questions:
  - question: What is tree diameter?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - The longest path between any two nodes
      - The number of edges in the tree
      - The sum of all edge weights
      - The depth from root
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Diameter is the longest simple path in the tree. It spans from one leaf (or node) to another, passing through the tree.

  - question: After removing one edge from a tree, what happens?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Tree remains connected
      - Tree splits into 2 subtrees
      - All nodes become isolated
      - Cycles form
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Removing an edge from a tree disconnects it into exactly 2 subtrees (component on each side of the removed edge).

  - question: For each edge removal, what is the new diameter?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Sum of subtree diameters
      - Max(diameter of subtree A, diameter of subtree B)
      - Longest path that doesn't use the removed edge
      - Half of original diameter
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: After removing edge (u,v), nodes split into subtree containing u and subtree containing v. Maximum path in each subtree is the new diameter.

  - question: In the Rerooting DP solution, what is computed in the first (bottom-up) phase?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Subtree diameters and heights
      - Node potentials
      - Edge capacities
      - Distances from root
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "Bottom-up DFS computes: subtree_height[u], subtree_diameter[u] (max path within subtree). These are precomputed for each node."
