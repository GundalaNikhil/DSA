  - question: What are K edge-disjoint paths?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - K paths that don't share edges
      - K paths that don't share vertices
      - K shortest paths
      - K paths of equal length
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "Edge-disjoint paths share no common edges but may share vertices. Example: s→a→t and s→b→t are edge-disjoint (different edges, same vertices a and b)."

  - question: How is maximum edge-disjoint paths solved?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Greedy path finding
      - Max flow where all edges have capacity 1
      - Dynamic programming
      - DFS enumeration
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Menger's Theorem: max edge-disjoint paths = max flow with unit edge capacities. Run Dinic's Algorithm on the unit-capacity network."

  - question: For an undirected graph, how should edges be represented in the flow network?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Single directed edge in both directions
      - One undirected edge (capacity 2)
      - Two directed edges with capacity 1 each
      - Capacity depends on edge weight
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: "Undirected edge u-v becomes two directed edges: u→v (cap 1) and v→u (cap 1). This allows flow in both directions while enforcing 1 edge use."

  - question: What is Menger's Theorem for edge-disjoint paths?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Always K paths exist
      - Max edge-disjoint paths = max flow value (unit capacity network)
      - Depends on graph density
      - Applies only to bipartite graphs
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Menger: the maximum number of edge-disjoint s-t paths equals the maximum flow from s to t in a unit-capacity network."
