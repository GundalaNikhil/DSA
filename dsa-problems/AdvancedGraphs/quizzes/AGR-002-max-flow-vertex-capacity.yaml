  - question: What is the purpose of splitting a node with capacity C into u_in and u_out?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - To reduce graph size
      - To convert vertex capacity into an edge capacity constraint
      - To enable bidirectional flow
      - To improve Dinic's performance
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Vertex splitting converts the vertex capacity problem into a standard edge capacity problem. The internal edge u_in -> u_out with capacity C ensures the total flow through u cannot exceed C.

  - question: When converting edges in vertex splitting, which statement is correct? (Select all that apply)
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Original edge u->v becomes u_out->v_in
      - Original edge u->v becomes u_in->v_out
      - Both directions must be handled in undirected graphs
      - The edge capacity remains the same
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Flow exits u via u_out and enters v via v_in, so u->v becomes u_out->v_in. Undirected edges need both directions. Edge capacities stay the same (only vertex capacity is encoded in the internal edge).

  - question: For the college fest example, if registration desk (node B) has capacity 3, how is this represented?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Reduce all incoming edge capacities to 3
      - Add internal edge B_in->B_out with capacity 3
      - Reduce the node's outgoing edge capacities
      - Use a separate constraint during max-flow
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The internal edge B_in->B_out with capacity 3 acts as a bottleneck. Any flow trying to pass through B must go through this edge, limiting total throughput to 3.

  - question: What happens if source S or sink T has a capacity limit?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - The limit applies to flow generation/consumption
      - We typically set their capacity to infinity (they are unconstrained)
      - We must enforce it with u_in->u_out edges
      - The algorithm fails
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: By convention, source and sink are unconstrained. They represent infinite flow sources and sinks. Only specify limits for S or T if the problem explicitly requires it.
