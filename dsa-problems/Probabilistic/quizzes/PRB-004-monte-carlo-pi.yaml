  - question: Given a ratio `p_hat` of random points falling inside a quarter circle within a unit square, what is the formula to estimate Pi?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "`4 * p_hat`"
      - "`p_hat`"
      - "`p_hat / 4`"
      - "`2 * p_hat`"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The area of a unit quarter circle is `pi/4` and the area of the unit square is 1. The probability of landing inside is `pi/4`, so `p_hat approx pi/4`, meaning `pi approx 4 * p_hat`.

  - question: Why do we multiply the standard error of the proportion `p` by 4 when calculating the confidence interval for Pi?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Because `Pi_hat = 4 * p_hat`, so the variability (standard deviation) also scales by a factor of 4.
      - Because determining Pi requires 4 quadrants.
      - It is an arbitrary safety factor.
      - Because the square root of 16 is 4.
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: If a random variable `X` is scaled by a constant `c` (`Y = cX`), the standard deviation scales by `|c|`. Since our estimator is `4 * p_hat`, the standard error is `4 * SE(p_hat)`.

  - question: According to the Law of Large Numbers, what happens as the number of samples `N` increases?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - The estimate `pi_hat` converges to the true value of `pi`.
      - The error increases linearly.
      - The estimate fluctuates wildly without bounding.
      - The result becomes exactly `pi` at `N=100`.
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The Law of Large Numbers states that the sample average converges to the expected value (true mean) as the sample size approaches infinity.

  - question: What numerical type should be used for these calculations to avoid precision issues?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "`double` (floating point)"
      - "`int`"
      - "`boolean`"
      - "`short`"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Calculations involving division, square roots, and probabilities require floating-point arithmetic (double) to maintain precision.
