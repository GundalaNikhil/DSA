questions:
  - question: In an absorbing Markov chain with transient state submatrix `Q`, what is the Fundamental Matrix `N`?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - "`N = (I - Q)^(-1)`"
      - "`N = I + Q`"
      - "`N = (I + Q)^(-1)`"
      - "`N = Q * R`"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The fundamental matrix `N` represents the expected number of times the process visits each transient state before absorption. It is derived from the infinite geometric series `I + Q + Q^2 + ...`, which theoretically sums to `(I - Q)^(-1)`.

  - question: How do you calculate the expected total number of steps until absorption starting from a specific transient state `i`?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 10
    options:
      - Sum the elements of the `i`-th row of the Fundamental Matrix `N`.
      - It is the `i`-th diagonal element of `N`.
      - It is the sum of the `i`-th column of `Q`.
      - It is always infinite.
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Since `N[i][j]` is the expected number of visits to state `j` starting from `i`, summing these values over all possible transient states `j` gives the total expected steps.

  - question: If `R` is the transition matrix from transient to absorbing states, how do you compute the probability of being absorbed into a specific absorbing state?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 10
    options:
      - Compute `B = N * R`. `B[i][j]` is the probability of starting at transient state `i` and ending at absorbing state `j`.
      - Compute `B = Q * R`.
      - Compute `B = R * N`.
      - It is just the values in `R`.
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We multiply the expected visits to each transient state (`N`) by the probability of jumping from those states to a specific absorbing state (`R`).

  - question: What is the primary computational bottleneck for solving this problem?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Matrix Inversion, which takes `O(n^3)`.
      - Matrix Multiplication, which takes `O(n^2)`.
      - Identifying absorbing states, which takes `O(n)`.
      - Reading the input.
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Calculating the Fundamental Matrix `N = (I - Q)^(-1)` requires inverting a matrix, which generally has cubic time complexity.
