questions:
  - question: Given `n` elements and a promotion probability `p`, what is the expected maximum height `H` of a Skip List?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 10
    options:
      - "`H approx log_n(1/p)`"
      - "`H approx log_{1/p}(n)`"
      - "`H approx n * p`"
      - "`H approx log_2(n)` regardless of p"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The expected height is determined by the base of the logarithm, which depends on the inverse of the probability `p`. Specifically, `H = ln(n) / ln(1/p)`.

  - question: The height of a single element in a Skip List follows which probability distribution?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 10
    options:
      - Geometric Distribution
      - Binomial Distribution
      - Normal Distribution
      - Uniform Distribution
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We repeatedly flip a coin (probability `p`) to decide if a node grows taller. This 'failures until success' (or sequence of successes) model is the definition of a Geometric distribution.

  - question: What is the trade-off when choosing a smaller value for `p` (e.g., 0.25 vs 0.5)?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - The Skip List uses less space (fewer pointers) but has a greater height (slower search).
      - The Skip List uses more space and becomes shorter.
      - The Skip List becomes a Linked List.
      - The search time becomes O(1).
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: A smaller `p` means fewer nodes satisfy the condition to be promoted, saving pointer space. However, this creates larger gaps between express stops, increasing the height/path length for searches.

  - question: How does the expected height scale with the number of elements `n`?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Logarithmically (O(log n))
      - Linearly (O(n))
      - Quadratically (O(n^2))
      - Constant (O(1))
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Like balanced trees, Skip Lists maintain a logarithmic height relative to `n` to ensure efficient O(log n) operations.
