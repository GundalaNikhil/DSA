  - question: What is the primary advantage of Reservoir Sampling over shuffling the entire dataset?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - It requires only O(k) memory and processes data in a single pass (streaming).
      - It is faster because it sorts the data.
      - It guarantees a deterministic output without a seed.
      - It works with infinite k.
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Reservoir sampling is designed for streaming data where N is large or unknown, allowing uniform sampling with fixed memory O(k) and linear time O(N).

  - question: In Algorithm R, when processing the i-th item (where i > k), what is the probability that it replaces an item currently in the reservoir?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 10
    options:
      - k / i
      - 1 / i
      - 1 / k
      - "0.5"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The algorithm decides to select the i-th item with probability `k/i`. If selected, it replaces a random existing element.

  - question: After processing N items, what is the probability that any specific item X (where X <= N) is in the final reservoir of size k?
    difficulty: hard
    points: 15
    options:
      - k / N
      - 1 / N
      - k / (N - 1)
      - "0.5"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The goal of reservoir sampling is to ensure every item has an equal probability of `k/N` of being included in the final sample.

  - question: Why does the problem require a specific 64-bit Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 10
    options:
      - To ensure deterministic reproducibility across different languages for testing.
      - Because standard random number generators are too slow.
      - Because LCGs are cryptographically secure.
      - To avoid integer overflow.
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Standard RNGs vary by language and compiler. A specific LCG ensures that the sequence of random numbers (and thus the final reservoir) is identical for all correct implementations given the same seed.
