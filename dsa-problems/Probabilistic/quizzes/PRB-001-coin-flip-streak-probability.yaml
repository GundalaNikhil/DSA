  - question: What is the most efficient approach to calculating the probability of getting *at least* one streak of K consecutive heads?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "Complement Probability: Calculate the probability of *never* getting a streak of K heads, then subtract from 1."
      - "Direct Summation: Count all sequences with 1 streak, 2 streaks, etc., and sum them up."
      - "Monte Carlo Simulation: Simulate 1000 flips and count successes."
      - "Backtracking: Recursively find all valid paths."
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Directly counting overlapping streaks is complex (Inclusion-Exclusion). Counting the complement (zero streaks of length K) is a straightforward DP problem.

  - question: If `dp[i]` represents the number of sequences of length `i` with NO streak of `k` heads, what is the recurrence relation for `i > k`?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - "`dp[i] = 2 * dp[i-1] - dp[i-k-1]`"
      - "`dp[i] = 2 * dp[i-1]`"
      - "`dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]`"
      - "`dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-k]`"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We can extend any valid sequence of length `i-1` with H or T (2*dp[i-1]), but we must subtract those that end in `T` followed by `k-1` heads, which upon adding `H` form a forbidden `k`-streak. The number of such invalid extensions is `dp[i-k-1]` (the count before the `T` and `k-1` heads).

  - question: For `i < k`, what is the value of `dp[i]` (sequences with no streak of k heads)?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "`2^i` (All sequences are valid)"
      - "`0`"
      - "`i`"
      - "`2^i - 1`"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: If the sequence length `i` is strictly less than the required streak length `k`, it is impossible to form a streak of `k` heads, so all `2^i` possible binary sequences are valid.

  - question: What is the time complexity of the optimal DP solution?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - O(N)
      - O(N * K)
      - O(2^N)
      - O(N log N)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The DP state depends only on the length `i`, and computing each state takes constant time O(1) using the previous values. Thus, total time is linear O(N).
