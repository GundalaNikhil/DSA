questions:
  - question: What is the expected number of draws `E` needed to collect all `N` distinct coupons?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 10
    options:
      - "`E = N * (1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/N)`"
      - "`E = N * N`"
      - "`E = N * log(N)`"
      - "`E = 2^N`"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: This is the classic Coupon Collector formula involving the harmonic sum. Asymptotically, it is `N * ln(N)`.

  - question: The time to find the `i`-th new coupon after finding `i-1` coupons follows which distribution?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 10
    options:
      - Geometric Distribution
      - Exponential Distribution
      - Uniform Distribution
      - Poisson Distribution
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Each phase is a sequence of failures (getting a duplicate) until the first success (getting a new coupon), which is the definition of a Geometric distribution.

  - question: For large `N`, how does the expected number of draws scale?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "`O(N log N)`"
      - "`O(N)`"
      - "`O(N^2)`"
      - "`O(log N)`"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The harmonic sum `H_N` grows logarithmically (`ln N`), so the total expectation `N * H_N` grows as `O(N log N)`.

  - question: Why does it take progressively longer to find the last few coupons?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Because the probability of drawing a *new* coupon decreases as we collect more coupons (most draws become duplicates).
      - Because the coupons run out of stock.
      - Because the probability of drawing any coupon changes.
      - It doesn't; each coupon takes the same time to find.
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Initially, almost any draw gives a new coupon. When only 1 is missing, the probability of success is only `1/N`, requiring an expected `N` draws for just the last item.
