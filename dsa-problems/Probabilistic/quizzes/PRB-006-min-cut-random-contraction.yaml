  - question: What is the lower bound on the probability that a single run of Karger's algorithm finds the global min-cut in a graph with `n` vertices?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 10
    options:
      - "`2 / (n * (n - 1))`"
      - "`1 / n`"
      - "`1 / n^2`"
      - "`1 / 2^n`"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: There are `n-2` contractions. The probability of NOT contracting a min-cut edge at step `i` is `(n-i-2)/(n-i)`. Multiplying these probabilities yields `2/(n(n-1))`.

  - question: Given a single-trial success probability `p` and a desired confidence `P`, which formula calculates the minimum trials `t` needed?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - "`t >= ln(1 - P) / ln(1 - p)`"
      - "`t >= P / p`"
      - "`t >= (1 - P) / (1 - p)`"
      - "`t >= log(P) / log(p)`"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: We want the probability of *all* trials failing `(1-p)^t` to be at most `1-P`. Taking logs gives `t * ln(1-p) <= ln(1-P)`. Since `ln(1-p)` is negative, dividing flips the inequality.

  - question: The success probability of Karger's algorithm is roughly `2/n^2`. How does this affect the number of trials needed for a high confidence?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - The number of trials must be proportional to `n^2`.
      - The number of trials must be proportional to `n`.
      - The number of trials must be exponential in `n`.
      - Only 1 trial is ever needed.
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Since the success probability is `O(1/n^2)`, we need `O(n^2)` trials to boost the overall success probability to a constant close to 1.

  - question: Which operation is central to Karger's algorithm?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "Edge Contraction: Merging two vertices connected by a random edge into a single super-vertex."
      - "Edge Deletion: Removing edges with max weight."
      - "Vertex Splitting: Creating new nodes."
      - Depth First Search.
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Karger's algorithm repeatedly picks a random edge and contracts it (merges endpoints), removing self-loops, until only two super-vertices remain.
