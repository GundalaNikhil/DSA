  - question: Given strings a='abcxyz' and b='bcxyzpq', what is the longest common substring?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "'ab'"
      - "'bcxyz'"
      - "'xyz'"
      - "'q'"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The substring 'bcxyz' (length 5) appears in both strings. 'xyz' (length 3) also appears in both but is shorter. No longer common substring exists.

  - question: Why is binary search suitable for finding the longest common substring?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - It reduces time complexity to O(n)
      - "The answer satisfies a monotone property: if a substring of length k exists, then length k-1 must exist"
      - It finds all substrings in order
      - It guarantees a collision-free hash
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: If a common substring of length L exists between two strings, then a common substring of length L-1 must also exist. This monotone property enables binary search on the answer.

  - question: In the binary search + rolling hash approach, after choosing a candidate length L, what is the correct procedure?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Compare all substrings of A and B character-by-character
      - Compute all length-L substring hashes of A, store in a set, then compute hashes of B and check for a match in the set
      - Use double hashing only if L > 100
      - Directly compare A and B without hashing
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: For each candidate length, we compute rolling hashes of all length-L substrings in O(n) time for each string. Storing A's hashes in a set and checking B's hashes enables O(1) average lookup.

  - question: What is the overall time complexity of binary search + rolling hash for strings of length n and m?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(n²)
      - O((n+m) × log(min(n,m)))
      - O(n×m)
      - O(n+m)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Binary search has O(log(min(n,m))) iterations. Each iteration checks if a common substring of length L exists in O(n+m) time. Total: O((n+m) × log(min(n,m)))."
