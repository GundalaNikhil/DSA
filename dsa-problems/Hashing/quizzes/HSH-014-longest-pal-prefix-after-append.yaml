questions:
  - question: Given s='abac' and we append 'a', the new string is 'abaca'. What is the longest palindromic prefix?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "'a'"
      - "'aba'"
      - "'abaca'"
      - "'abac'"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "'aba' is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), and it's the longest palindromic prefix of 'abaca'."

  - question: What does a forward hash track in this algorithm?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - The hash of the first character only
      - The cumulative polynomial hash of the prefix up to the current character
      - The reverse of the string
      - The character count
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Forward hash computes H_fwd = (H_fwd × B + char) % M, tracking the polynomial hash of s[0..i] after each character is appended.

  - question: In the reverse hash tracking, why does the power of B increase with each character?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - To speed up computation
      - "To match the reverse structure: new characters are added at the 'beginning' of the reversed string, requiring higher powers"
      - To prevent overflow
      - It doesn't; it stays constant
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: When appending character c, it joins the end of s, which becomes the beginning of reverse(s). This corresponds to the highest power of B in the reverse hash.

  - question: If forward hash and reverse hash match for a prefix s[0..i], what can we conclude?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - The prefix is a palindrome
      - The prefix has duplicate characters
      - The prefix is the entire string
      - Nothing; we need more information
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Hash(s[0..i]) == Hash(reverse(s[0..i])) means the prefix reads the same forwards and backwards, confirming it's a palindrome.
