  - question: Given string 'banana', what is the reverse string used in the palindrome check algorithm?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "'ananab'"
      - "'ananab' (reverse order)"
      - "'banana' (same)"
      - "'nananab'"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The reverse of 'banana' is 'ananab'. We precompute hashes of both the original and reversed string to check if any substring is a palindrome.

  - question: For string s='banana' and query (1, 3) representing substring 'ana', what are the corresponding indices in the reversed string?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - (1, 3) in reversed
      - (2, 4) in reversed
      - (5, 3) in reversed
      - (3, 1) in reversed
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "For substring s[l..r] in the original string, the reverse indices are rev_l = n-1-r and rev_r = n-1-l. Here: n=6, l=1, r=3, so rev_l=6-1-3=2, rev_r=6-1-1=4."

  - question: Why can palindrome checking be reduced to comparing hashes instead of reversing the substring?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Reversing is impossible in most programming languages
      - Substring reversal is O(L) for each query. Pre-hashing the reversed string enables O(1) palindrome checks via hash comparison
      - Hash comparison always gives correct results
      - Reversed substrings cannot be computed
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Reversing a substring and comparing it character-by-character is O(L) per query. Instead, we precompute hashes of the original and reversed strings, enabling O(1) palindrome checks via index mapping.

  - question: What is the space complexity of the palindrome checking algorithm and why?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(1) - only a few variables needed
      - O(n) - for storing prefix hashes of both original and reversed string
      - O(n²) - for storing all substrings
      - O(q) - for storing query results
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "We store two arrays of prefix hashes: one for the original string and one for the reversed string. Each array is O(n), giving total O(n) space complexity."
