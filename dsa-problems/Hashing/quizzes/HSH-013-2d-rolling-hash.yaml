  - question: In 2D rolling hash, which approach is used to compute the hash of a 2D submatrix?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Hash each row independently
      - Hash all rows first (base B1), then hash the resulting row-hashes (base B2)
      - Hash each element individually and sum
      - Use only one base for both dimensions
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "2D hashing is separable: compute row hashes using B1, then treat these hashes as a 1D array and hash them using B2."

  - question: Why must we use different bases B1 and B2 in 2D rolling hash?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - To make the computation faster
      - Using the same base could allow different 2D patterns to collide
      - It's not required, but recommended
      - To prevent negative hashes
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Using different bases ensures that the order and nesting of hash operations matter. Same base for both could lead to incorrect equivalences.

  - question: In 2D rolling hash, what is the first step when computing row-wise hashes?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Sum all elements in each row
      - Compute polynomial hash of each row using base B1
      - Extract the pattern matrix
      - Compute column sums
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: First, we compute rolling hashes for each row using B1 to get a 1D array of row hashes. Then, we hash this 1D array using B2.

  - question: What is the time complexity of computing 2D rolling hashes for an n×m matrix?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(n×m)
      - O(n + m)
      - O(n×m log(n×m))
      - O((n×m)²)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: "We process each row (O(m)) and then process the resulting row-hashes (O(n)). Total: O(n×m)."
