  - question: For string 'aaaa' with substring length L=2, how many pairs of equal substrings exist?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "1"
      - "2"
      - "3"
      - "6"
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: "Substrings: 'aa' at [0,1], 'aa' at [1,2], 'aa' at [2,3]. All three are equal, giving C(3,2) = 3 pairs: (0,1), (0,2), (1,2)."

  - question: If k substrings have identical double hashes, how many pairs are formed from these k substrings?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - k
      - k(k-1)
      - k(k-1)/2
      - k²
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: "Pairs are unordered combinations: C(k,2) = k(k-1)/2. For k=3: 3×2/2 = 3 pairs."

  - question: Why is double hashing essential in this problem rather than single hashing?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - To count faster
      - "To reduce false positives: single hash has ~1/M collision probability per pair, but double hash has ~1/(M1×M2) ≈ 10^-18"
      - To increase the pair count
      - It has no specific benefit
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: With millions of substrings, single hash collision probability becomes significant. Double hashing ensures pairs are truly equal with confidence ~1/10^18.

  - question: What is the space complexity of grouping substring hashes?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(1)
      - O(n) where n is string length
      - O(L²) where L is substring length
      - O(n × L)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "We store hashes for all O(n) substrings of length L in a map. Total space: O(n) entries in the hash map."
