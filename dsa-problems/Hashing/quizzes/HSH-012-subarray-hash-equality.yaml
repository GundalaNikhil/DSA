  - question: For integer array [1, 2, 1, 2], which subarrays are equal?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "[1] and [1] only"
      - "[1,2] and [1,2]"
      - "[2,1] and [2,1] if they exist"
      - All of the above
    correct_answer: 3
    explanation: Integer arrays can be compared just like strings. [1,2] at indices [0,1] equals [1,2] at indices [2,3], and [1] appears at indices 0 and 2.

  - question: How should negative integers be handled in rolling hash?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Ignore them and skip processing
      - Use direct ASCII values like strings
      - "Apply modular arithmetic: (val % MOD + MOD) % MOD to ensure positive hashes"
      - Convert to positive with absolute value
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: "Negative modulo in languages like C++ can produce negative results. Adding MOD before taking modulo ensures positive values: (x % M + M) % M."

  - question: Why should the base B be larger than the maximum element value in the array?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - To make hashing faster
      - To ensure polynomial representation integrity (treats each element as a 'digit' in base B)
      - To prevent integer overflow
      - It has no specific reason
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: For array elements treated as base-B digits, if B ≤ max_element, the polynomial representation may be ambiguous or incorrect.

  - question: What is the time complexity for answering q queries on an integer array of length n?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(n×q)
      - O(n + q)
      - O(n log n + q log q)
      - O(q²)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Preprocessing: O(n) for computing prefix hashes and powers. Per query: O(1) hash comparison using the substring hash formula. Total: O(n + q)."
