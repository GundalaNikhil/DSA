questions:
  - question: Two words are connected if they become anagrams after removing exactly one character from each. Which pairs are connected?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "'abc' and 'def' (no connection)"
      - "'abc' and 'bca' (both anagrams of each other)"
      - "'abc' and 'bc' (if we remove 'a' and 'b' leaves 'bc' and nothing)"
      - "'abcd' and 'abc' (remove 'd' from first, but nothing from second)"
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: For 'abc' and 'def', there's no way to remove one character from each and get anagrams. They're not connected.

  - question: Why must we sort the characters in a reduced form (word after removing one character)?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - To make it alphabetically ordered
      - "To create a canonical anagram signature: 'abc' and 'bca' both reduce to the same forms"
      - To speed up removal
      - It's optional
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Sorting ensures that anagrams have the same canonical form. For example, both 'bac' and 'abc' after removing 'c' become 'ab'.

  - question: In Union-Find, why is path compression important when grouping words?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - To make the code shorter
      - To reduce amortized time complexity to nearly O(1) per operation, making large unions efficient
      - To save space
      - It's not necessary
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: With path compression, union-find operations approach O(1) amortized time. This is critical when processing thousands of word connections.

  - question: How many reduced forms (intermediate signatures) are generated for a word of length L?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - L
      - L-1
      - L+1
      - 2^L
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: For each position in the word, we remove one character. A word of length L has exactly L positions, giving L reduced forms.
