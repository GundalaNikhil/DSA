  - question: For string 'bba', what is the lexicographically smallest rotation?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "'bba'"
      - "'bab'"
      - "'abb'"
      - "'aab'"
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: "The three rotations are 'bba', 'bab', 'abb'. Comparing: 'abb' < 'bab' < 'bba', so 'abb' is the smallest."

  - question: Why is the string doubled (s+s) in this algorithm?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - To handle negative indices
      - To enable accessing all rotations without modulo arithmetic
      - To increase the string length for hashing
      - To prevent overflow
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Doubling the string allows all rotations to be accessed as substrings: s[i...i+n-1] for i=0 to n-1 represents each rotation."

  - question: In binary search on LCP (Longest Common Prefix), what is checked to compare two rotations at equal LCP?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - The first character only
      - The character at index (start1 + LCP) vs (start2 + LCP) in the doubled string
      - All remaining characters
      - The hash values only
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: After finding the LCP length, we compare characters at position (start1 + LCP) and (start2 + LCP) to determine which rotation is lexicographically smaller.

  - question: What is the time complexity of finding the minimal rotation using binary search + rolling hash?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(n)
      - O(n log n)
      - O(n²)
      - O(n log² n)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: There are O(n) possible rotations, and binary search on LCP for each pair takes O(log n) hash comparisons, giving O(n log n) total.
