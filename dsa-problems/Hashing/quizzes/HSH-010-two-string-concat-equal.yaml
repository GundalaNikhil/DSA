questions:
  - question: Given a='ab', b='cd', c='a', d='bcd', are a+b and c+d equal?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - No, they are different strings
      - Yes, both equal 'abcd'
      - Cannot determine without comparing character-by-character
      - Need to concatenate first to check
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: a+b = 'ab'+'cd' = 'abcd', and c+d = 'a'+'bcd' = 'abcd'. Both are equal.

  - question: What is the formula for computing Hash(a+b) from Hash(a) and Hash(b)?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - Hash(a+b) = Hash(a) + Hash(b)
      - Hash(a+b) = Hash(a) × B^|b| + Hash(b)
      - Hash(a+b) = Hash(a) × |b| + Hash(b)
      - Hash(a+b) = Hash(a) × Hash(b)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "The formula treats a+b as a base-B polynomial: a occupies the high-order positions (shifted by |b| positions), so Hash(a+b) = Hash(a) × B^|b| + Hash(b)."

  - question: Why must we check length equality before hashing?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - It saves computation time
      - Strings of different lengths can never be equal; avoids unnecessary hashing
      - Hash values are length-dependent
      - It prevents integer overflow
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: If |a|+|b| ≠ |c|+|d|, the concatenated strings must differ. This quick check avoids hashing computation for impossible cases.

  - question: For strings a='xyz' (length 3) and b='abc' (length 3), when computing Hash(a+b), what power of B is used?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - B^3
      - B^0
      - B^6
      - B^(3+3)
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Hash(a+b) = Hash(a) × B^|b| + Hash(b) = Hash(a) × B^3 + Hash(b), because string b has length 3.
