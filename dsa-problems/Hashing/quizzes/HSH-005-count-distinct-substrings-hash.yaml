questions:
  - question: For string 'aaa', how many distinct substrings are there?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "3"
      - "4"
      - "5"
      - "6"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: "Distinct substrings are: '', 'a', 'aa', 'aaa'. Total = 4. The empty string counts as one distinct substring."

  - question: What is the maximum number of substrings (including empty) for a string of length n?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - n
      - n(n+1)/2
      - n(n+1)/2 + 1
      - 2^n
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: There are n*(n+1)/2 non-empty substrings plus 1 empty string, giving n*(n+1)/2 + 1 total substrings.

  - question: Why is using rolling hash better than constructing actual substring strings?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - Hash values are always smaller
      - Rolling hash avoids O(n³) string operations and O(n² × L) space for storing substrings
      - Hash is cryptographically secure
      - Rolling hash prevents collisions
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Constructing all substrings explicitly takes O(n² × L) space and O(n³) time. Rolling hash gives us O(n²) time with O(n) per substring generation.

  - question: With single hashing and a modulus M, what is the probability of a hash collision?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - ~1/M per pair
      - ~1/n for n substrings
      - Zero (deterministic)
      - Guaranteed for more than M substrings
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Each hash pair has ~1/M collision probability. With n² possible substrings and M ~10⁹, false negatives are possible without double hashing.
