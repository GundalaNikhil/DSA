  - question: For string 'abcabc', what is the longest substring that appears at least twice without overlap?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "'a'"
      - "'ab'"
      - "'abc'"
      - "'abca'"
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: "'abc' appears at positions [0,2] and [3,5]. These don't overlap, and no longer substring appears twice non-overlapping."

  - question: What is the non-overlapping condition when the same hash appears at positions pos1 and pos2 for length L?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - pos1 < pos2
      - pos2 > pos1 + L
      - pos2 >= pos1 + L
      - pos2 - pos1 > L
    correct_answer: 2
    explanation: "For non-overlap, the second occurrence must start at or after the end of the first: pos2 >= pos1 + L."

  - question: Why is binary search on the answer length suitable for this problem?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - It reduces memory usage
      - "The answer satisfies monotonicity: if length L has a non-overlapping repeat, then L-1 also does"
      - Hash collisions are eliminated
      - It guarantees finding all repeats
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: If a substring of length L appears twice non-overlapping, then any substring of length L-1 from those can also appear twice non-overlapping. This enables binary search.

  - question: What is the time complexity of this algorithm for a string of length n?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(n)
      - O(n log n)
      - O(n²)
      - O(n² log n)
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Binary search has O(log n) iterations. Each iteration processes all substrings of a given length in O(n) using rolling hash, giving O(n log n) total.
