  - question: For string 'ababab', what is the minimum period?
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - "1"
      - "2"
      - "3"
      - "6"
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: The string 'ababab' = 'ab' repeated 3 times, so the minimum period is 2.

  - question: "A string has period p if it can be decomposed into: s = pattern + pattern + ... (repeated). If n=12, which values CANNOT be valid periods?"
    difficulty: easy
    points: 10
    options:
      - 2, 3, 4, 6
      - 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
      - 1, 6, 12 only
      - All odd numbers
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: Valid periods must be divisors of n. For n=12, divisors are 1,2,3,4,6,12. All others (5,7,8,9,10,11) cannot be periods.

  - question: "To check if period p exists, we use the 'shift trick': s[0..n-p-1] == s[p..n-1]. Why does this work?"
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - It compares the first half with the second half
      - If period p exists, the prefix of length (n-p) must equal the suffix shifted by p positions
      - It verifies the pattern length
      - It prevents hash collisions
    correct_answer: 1
    explanation: If the string has period p, then removing p characters from the end (s[0..n-p-1]) equals removing p characters from the start (s[p..n-1]).

  - question: What is the time complexity of checking all possible periods for a string of length n?
    difficulty: medium
    points: 15
    options:
      - O(n)
      - O(n log n)
      - O(√n)
      - O(d(n)) where d(n) is the number of divisors
    correct_answer: 3
    explanation: We check only divisors of n. For n=2×10⁵, the maximum divisor count is O(log n), making this very efficient after O(n) preprocessing.
