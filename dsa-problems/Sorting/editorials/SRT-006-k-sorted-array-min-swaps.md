# K-Sorted Array Minimum Swaps - Editorial

## Problem Summary

You are given an array of size `n` which is "k-sorted". This means each element is at most `k` positions away from its correct sorted position. You need to find the minimum number of swaps required to sort this array.

## Real-World Scenario

Imagine a **Classroom Seating Arrangement**.
-   Students are assigned seats based on their roll numbers.
-   However, they sat down somewhat randomly, but mostly near their correct seats (within `k` desks).
-   The teacher wants to rearrange them into the correct order.
-   The teacher can swap any two students.
-   What is the minimum number of swaps needed to get everyone in the right seat?

## Problem Exploration

### 1. Minimum Swaps to Sort
-   The problem of finding the minimum number of swaps to sort any array is solved using cycle decomposition.
-   The `k`-sorted property hints at the structure but doesn't change the fundamental algorithm.
-   The standard cycle decomposition method is optimal regardless of `k`.

### 2. Cycle Decomposition
-   To sort an array with minimum swaps, we can view the permutation as a set of disjoint cycles.
-   If an element at index `i` needs to go to index `j`, and the element at `j` needs to go to `k`, and so on, eventually we return to `i`. This forms a cycle.
-   For a cycle of length `L`, we need `L-1` swaps to place all elements in their correct positions.
-   The total minimum swaps = `Sum(Cycle Length - 1)` for all cycles.
-   Equivalently, `Total Swaps = N - (Number of Cycles)`.

### 3. Algorithm
1.  Create a list of pairs `(value, original_index)`.
2.  Sort this list by `value`. Now, the element at index `i` in the sorted list tells us that the element originally at `pair[i].original_index` should end up at position `i`.
    -   Let `target[i]` be the correct sorted position of the element currently at `arr[i]`.
    -   Or, construct a mapping: `current_pos -> target_pos`.
    -   If we have duplicate values, we must be careful. Stability matters?
    -   Usually, for "min swaps", if there are duplicates, any valid assignment to sorted positions is fine. However, to minimize swaps, we should map the `p`-th occurrence of value `X` in the input to the `p`-th occurrence of value `X` in the sorted array. This avoids unnecessary swaps between identical values.
4.  Build a `visited` array.
5.  Iterate `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
    -   If `visited[i]` or element is already in place, continue.
    -   Start a cycle traversal from `i`.
    -   Count cycle length `L`.
    -   Add `L-1` to total swaps.

## Approaches

### Approach 1: Cycle Decomposition
-   Pair elements with indices.
-   Sort pairs to find target positions.
-   Decompose into cycles.
-   Complexity: `O(N log N)` due to sorting. Cycle counting is `O(N)`.

## Implementations

### Java

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public long minSwapsToSort(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        // Store (value, original_index)
        int[][] pairs = new int[n][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            pairs[i][0] = arr[i];
            pairs[i][1] = i;
        }
        
        // Sort to find correct positions
        Arrays.sort(pairs, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
        
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
        long swaps = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (visited[i] || pairs[i][1] == i) {
                continue;
            }
            
            int cycleSize = 0;
            int j = i;
            while (!visited[j]) {
                visited[j] = true;
                // Move to the index where the element at j currently is
                // No. pairs is sorted.
                // pairs[i] is the element that belongs at index i.
                // Its current position is pairs[i].original_index.
                // So we have a mapping: position i needs element from pairs[i].original_index.
                // This defines a permutation.
                
                j = pairs[j][1];
                cycleSize++;
            }
            
            if (cycleSize > 0) {
                swaps += (cycleSize - 1);
            }
        }
        
        return swaps;
    }
}
```

### Python

```python
def min_swaps_to_sort(arr: list[int]) -> int:
    n = len(arr)
    # Create pairs (value, original_index)
    pairs = [(arr[i], i) for i in range(n)]
    
    # Sort pairs to know where each element belongs
    # If duplicates exist, Python's stable sort preserves relative order
    # which is optimal for minimizing swaps (don't swap identicals)
    pairs.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    
    visited = [False] * n
    swaps = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        if visited[i] or pairs[i][1] == i:
            continue
            
        cycle_size = 0
        j = i
        while not visited[j]:
            visited[j] = True
            # The element that belongs at j is currently at pairs[j][1]
            # This forms the cycle j -> pairs[j][1] -> ...
            j = pairs[j][1]
            cycle_size += 1
            
        if cycle_size > 0:
            swaps += (cycle_size - 1)
            
    return swaps
```

            }
            
            int cycleSize = 0;
            int j = i;
            while (!visited[j]) {
                visited[j] = true;
                j = pairs[j].second;
                cycleSize++;
            }
            
            if (cycleSize > 0) {
                swaps += (cycleSize - 1);
            }
        }
        
        return swaps;
    }
};
```

### JavaScript

    const n = arr.length;
    const pairs = arr.map((val, idx) => ({ val, idx }));
    
    // Sort pairs
    pairs.sort((a, b) => a.val - b.val);
    
    const visited = new Array(n).fill(false);
    let swaps = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (visited[i] || pairs[i].idx === i) {
        continue;
      }
      
      let cycleSize = 0;
      let j = i;
      while (!visited[j]) {
        visited[j] = true;
        j = pairs[j].idx;
        cycleSize++;
      }
      
      if (cycleSize > 0) {
        swaps += (cycleSize - 1);
      }
    }
    
    return swaps;
  }
}
```

## 🧪 Test Case Walkthrough (Dry Run)
**Input:**
`3 2`
`3 1 2`

1.  **Pairs**: `[(3,0), (1,1), (2,2)]`.
2.  **Sorted Pairs**: `[(1,1), (2,2), (3,0)]`.
    -   Index 0 needs element from index 1.
    -   Index 1 needs element from index 2.
    -   Index 2 needs element from index 0.
3.  **Cycles**:
    -   Start at 0: `0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0`.
    -   Cycle: `0 -> 1 -> 2`. Size 3.
4.  **Swaps**: `3 - 1 = 2`.

## Proof of Correctness

-   **Cycle Property**: Any permutation can be decomposed into disjoint cycles.
-   **Swaps per Cycle**: To resolve a cycle of `L` elements (put them all in correct places), we need exactly `L-1` swaps. For example, `2 -> 3 -> 1` (indices). Swap `1` into place, then `2` into place.
-   **Independence**: Swaps within one cycle do not affect other disjoint cycles.
-   **Optimality**: This is a known result in graph theory/combinatorics.

## Interview Extensions

1.  **What if we can only swap adjacent elements?**
    -   Then the answer is the number of **Inversions**.
2.  **What if K is very small (e.g., 1)?**
    -   If `K=1`, elements are at most 1 step away. The array consists of independent swaps of adjacent pairs.
    -   We can just count inversions or check pairs `(2i, 2i+1)`.

### Common Mistakes

-   **Confusing with Inversions**: Min swaps (any two) != Min adjacent swaps (inversions).
-   **Duplicates**: Ensure stable sort or consistent mapping to avoid swapping identical values unnecessarily.
-   **Visited Array**: Forget to mark visited nodes leads to infinite loops.
